Now and then, Showalter is called upon to untangle the various waves of criticism and revival that works by writers including Dickinson, Sarah Orne Jewett, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eudora Welty have endured. Her approach in this thorny landscape (feminist criticism can be fierce) is unifying and magnanimous. She brings a perspective to changing literary culture that makes criticism seem not only understandable but also healthy and invigorating, making the work timeless in its ability to weather readers' changing priorities. Dickinson, for example, has been much criticized for her narrow window on life; Jewett and Welty for bourgeois views; and Millay for her self-styled insistence on domesticity.

In both studies, the participants were self-selecting, and its hard not to see the number as anything other than the statistical mean of a vastly wide-ranging spectrum.

The only reasonable solution is to provide attorneys to those immigrant detainees who need them. It would cost, of course, but due process comes with a price. And in some cases, assigning lawyers to detainees could actually lead to savings. The government spends an average of $40,000 a year on each detainee. Providing lawyers could help screen those cases. If a detainee had no legal case or grounds for relief, his attorney could explain that to him, and he would probably agree to leave the country rather than remain in detention, sometimes for years.

Again, even without a central scheme, and five hundred years ahead of Huxley’s schedule, the outcome is depressingly familiar. Books like Charles Murray’s “Coming Apart” have explored how class differences perpetuate and even harden: today two Stanford grads meet at Davos or Google, marry and produce more of same, whereas even a generation ago the classes mingled more: When people weren’t as mobile, a male executive was more likely to have married his neighbor or secretary. On the other side of the class divide, now that there’s no particular stigma to being a single parent, there is a similar feedback loop. You have kids out of wedlock, which means you drop out of school, which means you’re poor, which means your kids follow suit.

Andrew Madoff: The Turkey of the Year Award is reserved for a man who trashes the memory of his dead brother to feather the nest of his social-climbing girlfriend, who will reap the profits from their book on his diabolical family. “My brother was not a barrel of laughs,” Andrew Madoff began his eulogy for his brother Mark, who committed suicide last December. They call his father, Bernie, a monster, but I doubt even Bernie would treat a family member with such devastating disrespect.

"Not once, in the hundreds of chance meetings I had with wolves," Eisenberg says, "did one behave aggressively toward me. Indeed, they were curious about me, and often snuck up behind me, stole my field equipment, and then brought it back a day or two later slightly chewed and covered with wolf drool and wolf fur. This from a creature who can easily bite through steel."

Leadership PACS typically are heavily funded by lobbyists and corporate PACs and operate under looser rules than traditional political funds. Many also have more artful or obscure names, as evidenced by the $5,000 each McCaskill received from the Jazz PAC (Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.), the Narragansett Bay PAC (Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.), and the DAN PAC (Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii).

Modest, self-effacing, cool to the point of emotional distance, egalitarian, outdoorsy, wholesome, but also sardonic, quirky and decidedly anarchist at times, Brownstein is as Northwest as blown Pilchuck glass. She is also intensely self-critical, whip smart, befuddled by illogical people, maddeningly circumspect, expressive, quick to laugh, supremely self-confident, possessed of an explosive temper and, as an artist, apparently fearless.
But the fourth-quarter numbers limped across the finish line, showing a drop both in dollars and deals compared to the third quarter. And that third quarter represented a decline in activity compared to the second quarter, when investor enthusiasm soared after LinkedIn's initial public offering of stock. During the second quarter of 2011, venture firms poured $7.5 billion into 966 deals. In the most recent quarter, those figures were $6.6 billion and 844.

It's about whether to demand your side or ask for it; trying to control the person you're with or compromising. Is it OK for you to tell your partner how to handle his kids in a situation that has nothing to do with you? Do you have a right to tell her to stop humming all the time because it drives you crazy? Can you forbid him to watch TV in bed?

“From a strategic perspective, I think there’s a question about how much bang for the buck is there in a lot of additional spending on advertising for Romney,” Sides said. The margin of victory in the primary may not effect how well Romney does in November against President Obama. And considering how well funded Obama is expected to be, Romney might be better off saving his ammunition -- and dollars -- for the fall campaign.

Some GOP presidential candidates, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have signed a pledge to build a fence along the length of the southern border -- there is already more than 600 miles of towering steel fencing in place. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who does not support a border fence, has proposed adding to the 1,200 National Guard troops currently stationed along the border in a support role. Perry and Gingrich have both spoken of the need for "humanity" in dealing with illegal immigrants who are already here, and were both criticized by conservative Republicans.
Affton should get some more wind in its sails with the return tomorrow of 6-foot-4 senior Jon Tevebaugh, a stellar blocker who has been injured.
Hey, Tom: It's apples and oranges. Fox is a defensive specialist, so he is not tied to a particular offensive system. Pat Shurmur was brought to Cleveland with the marching orders to install the West Coast offense. A quarterback in that system has to operate in the pocket to allow the pass patterns to develop. If he can't, then a new quarterback must be found.
Fortunately, those dishes don't come very often, and there's never a misfire on desserts. Rulli creates more than a dozen each night. When the trilogy of chocolate ($8) was placed before a friend who didn't know the background of the restaurant, she asked who did the desserts, because "you can really see the passion in them." The plate contained an on-point rendition of molten chocolate cake, a rich candy-bar-like rectangle with a thin crisp crust, and a demitasse of rich hot chocolate.

IUDs can be removed at any time before their contraceptive duration expires, which ranges from five to 10 years. Once the IUD is removed (which must be done by an experienced clinician), research shows the woman's fertility returns almost immediately, and there is no evidence of any reproductive impairment. This is one of the most commonly cited reasons some women choose IUDs over permanent forms of birth control, such as tubal ligation, where a woman's fallopian tubes are surgically cut and tied off, intentionally resulting in sterility.
An analysis by the St. Petersburg newspaper showed that judges consistently give shooters a pass - provided they were not violating the law when they went after their victim.

“He’s been terrific to work with,” Sloan said. “He’s a very hard worker. He hasn’t been here, but he’s picked stuff up pretty well. He just needs to keep working, and everybody get comfortable with one another.”
In a sense, food culture seems to be toughing it through economic times because it's not just about dollars and calories. In the Bay Area, food has become the presiding metaphor for a consciously led life: pleasure, politics, identity and love for family all wrapped up in one. And that's one reason why staying home for the holidays may not be cheap, but it's almost guaranteed to be tasty. --

As in recent election years, voters nationwide rate social issues — including abortion and gay marriage — as far less important than the economy or jobs.

We had parted with the stated intention to stay friends, but I mostly avoided him despite his attempts to talk to or spend time with me. The following year, he had to leave school for a while because of mental illness. When he came back, I made an effort to be nice to him and do things with him, but I had a new boyfriend and T had a hard time accepting that. T began repeatedly calling my house, asking my friends about me and, after I went to college, repeatedly emailing me. This made me so uncomfortable that I finally sent him an email asking him to never contact me again. I have not heard from him since.
Being bad is one thing. Being bad and boring is the quickest way to create the negativity that former UF coach Urban Meyer used to refer to as "Gator nonsense." Florida fans, like most fans, want to win championships, but if you want to keep them happy in the meantime then give them an offense that's entertaining.

"Obviously, he's not swinging the same," said Lowe, who faced Pujols with the Dodgers and Braves the past seven seasons (and with the Red Sox in the 2004 World Series). "I don't care if you're a Hall of Famer like he is – confidence is everything in this game. When you start losing it and you start to question yourself (you start to press).
When Ruess first watched an early cut of the commercial, he wasn't sure if it was the type of kismet he wanted: "A car doing kick-flips or whatever the heck it is — if we had heard that was going to be the case, we probably would have said, 'No way.'" But he quickly began to enjoy it, especially how the "epic" ambience of the ad matched the feel of the song. When it aired during the Super Bowl, his main focus was waiting for his parents to call. After two hours, he couldn't stand it and texted them. They texted back, "Good job!"

The Standard & Poor's 500 index moved above its average close of the past 200 days, 1,108. The 200-day moving average is a technical level watched by many traders.

One side note: While there's evidence that EPA omega-3s may cut the risk of precancerous colon polyps (we've both had them removed), don't take extra EPA without consulting your doc. It can trigger both clotting and bleeding problems, and it doesn't play nice with certain drugs.
"This is going to be an extraordinary experience for people at the local level," said Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex), a reluctant partner in the compromise legislation shaped by Christie and Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester). "They will go to the polls and vote for an override in some instances, but that’s not going to be the case in every community."

Next year will see the release of three films that appeared on the 2011 festival circuit, "The Innkeepers," "Kill List" and "You're Next," all of which show that a bit of gore and a little brains (as in wit and smarts) need not be mutually exclusive. Fresh, vibrant filmmaking is happening on the indie horror scene, as kids raised on VHS cheapies have grown up to turn the form inside-out.
And - as with other types of high-tech equipment that hospitals market aggressively to attract patients who could go elsewhere - the proliferation of robotic systems can mean fewer procedures being done at each institution, a potential problem when higher volume is related to better outcomes.
Indeed, if his business is on a roll, so is de la Renta's relevance as a designer. His most recent collection, for spring 2012, was met with rave reviews. Critics praised his "exuberance" and cited the "insouciant luxe" that he does "like no one else," as well as a new "edginess" that reinvigorated his typical "glamour and elegance." At the show, Justin Timberlake and Ashley Olsen took front-row seats with such longtime clients as Barbara Walters. The mix of age and sensibility reflects his clientele. (Walters might go for the embroidered day dresses, and Olsen could easily carry off the crush pleated silk tulle strapless gown.) His multigenerational appeal may well lie in the fact that the designer himself is forever looking forward. He says—in an "Oscar-ism" inscribed on resin bangles sold only on the brand's Facebook page: "I have the memory of a mosquito." Astonishingly, he has never kept a single archive. "Why should I?" he asks. "I love now and tomorrow. What I did in the past doesn't interest me."
Administrators say that on the days kids would be home, teachers still would be on the job, working together to improve student learning.

James, who had a pretty clear indication that he would not be playing against Colorado unless something went horribly awry, decided that he didn't like what he saw from his teammates in warm-ups.

The paper's reviewer was careful to avoid calling the book a collection of love stories: "It's short fiction that raises all the messy questions surrounding affairs of the heart: Why him? Why her?

Europe uses a different—some industry officials say overly optimistic—set of calculations to estimate fuel efficiency (usually expressed as liters per 100 kilometers or grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, instead of miles per gallon). European regulators also give more mileage credit for technology such as stop-start systems than the U.S. does. Counting grams of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometer is a different way of measuring gasoline consumption since the more gasoline or diesel fuel a vehicle consumes, the more carbon dioxide it will emit. U.S. regulators are starting to compare vehicles based on carbon-dioxide emissions.

Many scholars believe that the new manual will increase addiction rates. A study by Australian researchers found, for example, that about 60 percent more people would be considered addicted to alcohol under the new standards.

Many of those accidents are due to "inattentional blindness," in which people can, in effect, turn a blind eye to things they aren't focusing on. Images land on our retinas and are either boosted or played down in the visual cortex before being passed to the brain, just as the auditory cortex filters sounds, as shown in the Nature study last week. "It's a push-pull relationship—the more we focus on one thing, the less we can focus on others," says Diane M. Beck, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois.

The proposed deal also is likely to increase government scrutiny on Google at a time when antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe already are parsing its business practices to determine whether it has been abusing its power to stifle competition. The inquiries are focused primarily on the company's Internet search and advertising businesses, but regulators are also looking into whether Google using Android to ensure its s services receive preferential treatment on devices using that free software.

For a president up for re-election, this will be a rare Asia trip devoted to just one country, built around a nuclear security summit that carries his imprint.

In New Jersey, we strive to provide better health care with less cost. President Obama’s plan does the reverse and cuts $3,700 worth of benefits for certain senior citizens, according to the Heritage Foundation, which estimated that lower-income earners and minorities would be hit hardest.That’s as responsible as sending up a hitter to face a 100 mph fastball without a helmet.Obamacare also places new taxes on health devices such as hearing aids, imaging machines, replacement hips and even the common tongue depressor. These costs will be passed on to consumers and have a chilling effect on the industry’s research and development budgets, meaning less innovation in this very important field. The billions of dollars’ worth of taxes added to insurers, prescriptions and medical devices will mean higher prices and fewer choices for patients. Some taxes will come right out of their pockets.

The most recent changes don't mean that data plans will always look this way, though. Some analysts suggest that carriers might eventually offer different speed tiers, perhaps charging more to always use a 4G network, or having customers start off using their 4G network and then switching to the slower 3G network after hitting a monthly data-usage allotment. T-Mobile's existing unlimited data plan flirts with this idea already.

Mr. Citerne said the bank didn't notice the unauthorized trading until last week because the trader had "intimate and malicious" knowledge of its procedures and knew at what dates checks were conducted. "Each time he took a position one way, he would enter a fictitious trade in the opposite direction to mask the real one," Mr. Citerne said. According to one person familiar with the situation, Mr. Kerviel used the computer log-in and passwords of colleagues both in the trading unit and the technology section.

The film itself can likewise be regarded as marginally clever. It employs the same conceit as its predecessor — that 21st century characters can rediscover the world within Jules Verne's novels, because the novels themselves were only disguised as fiction. This time, it's revealed that Robert Louis Stevenson and Jonathan Swift were playing the same game, allowing director Brad Peyton and the writers to combine Verne's “Mysterious Island” with a few minor elements from “Treasure Island” and “Gulliver's Travels.”

Haag's book "Marriage Confidential: The Post-Romantic Age of Workhouse Wives, Royal Children, Undersexed Spouses and Rebel Couples Who are Rewriting the Rules" sets out to put a face on the melancholy marriage and give examples of couples who are redefining marriage so it works better for them. About half the book challenges the notion of the importance of monogamy and rethinking its rules. Actually, it's not exactly a rewriting of rules but a revising of the time-honored hallmarks of ennui in marriage known as taking a mistress or lover.

I have a fantastic rescue dog, Haley, who lives with me and my family. I speak only Chinese to my parents and aunt in my household. Haley must know Chinese too. When she meets dogs at the dog park or the street, she can become scared or aggressive. I have to stay right with her and try to keep her under control because she barks, growls or wants to hide behind me. But if the dogs are also from Chinese-speaking homes (and I ask), my dog is relaxed. She plays, sniffs freely, and runs around. Does this make sense? -- Wen

It is difficult by order of magnitude. It's very hard to enforce copyright without violating other kinds of rights, especially privacy. But I don't think it's impossible. And it's interesting to notice that most of the people who argue that it's impossible are gaining a lot from piracy in one way or another. Public Knowledge, which is a public advocacy group in D.C. that gets some money from Google, will talk about how any kind of copyright enforcement risks people keeping track of what you're doing online. But I'm not worried about the data NBC Universal has about me. I'm much more worried about the amount of data Facebook has about me. People don't seem to be worried about that.

The Shwedagon Pagoda, a 2,500-year-old Buddhist temple, was built to enshrine relics, including, some say, eight hairs from Buddha's head. Over the centuries, monarchs built the central stupa, a tall bell-shaped dome (tourists cannot enter it), up to its present height of 320 feet and adorned it with 8,600 bricks covered with gold plates and nearly 80,000 diamonds and other precious stones. It's simply dazzling. At night, the golden stupa is lighted, giving the otherwise colorless city a beautiful focal point.

More startling than the writing of this law around Gonzales is the political reality that made such surgery necessary: Bush's refusal to remove Gonzales.

Although he wrote almost to the end (and he's published posthumously at a rate rivaled only by L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Kerouac), he had produced most of his important work by 1940, when "For Whom the Bell Tolls" appeared.

An environment in which a Nebraska woman reportedly had to deliver a baby knowing it would die minutes later, because doctors feared prosecution under the 20-week abortion ban.

Because many of you continue to ask, the Ravens sit just under $5 million under the salary cap as of this morning. They’ll have to set aside enough to sign their draft picks, although that won’t require as much money as usual because the Ravens pick 29th in the first round, and they don’t have a fourth-round pick after the Evans trade.

The details: Aromatic bitters are the shortstops of the cocktail world - indispensable but left until the very end of the conversation. Brad Thomas Parsons changes that with "Bitters: A Spirited History of a Classic Cure-All" ($24.99, Ten Speed Press, 232 pages). It includes the particulars of why bitters exist - first as a medicinal aid, then as an aromatic one - then spends ample space offering recipes on making your own bitters (that alone should keep hobbyists occupied for months) and, of course, the requisite drink recipes. It is a specific topic, but one that lies at the heart of great bartending. Now Parsons has given it proper respect.
øThe WNBA recruited Richie, who was aware of the league and had attended a few games but wasn't a diehard fan. But after hearing the WNBA's pitch, she realized that the job combined everything that was important to her.

In person, Cataldo is a bundle of infectious energy. During an interview at her Huntley home, 50 miles northwest of Chicago, she pops up from her office chair and slides sock-footed across the floor to fetch Goldfish crackers from her grocery stockpile for her 4-year-old son, Will. Later, she bounds up the stairs from her office/kiddie playroom to answer the doorbell. It's just the UPS guy with a package.

Automobiles are also central to Chinese society's cringe-worthy monetization of marriage. In 2010, on a popular TV show—"If You Are the One," a riff on "The Bachelor"—a female contestant gave Chinese society a soul-searching moment when she said she'd "rather cry in a BMW car than laugh on the back of a bicycle." The unblinking materialism of the remark outraged many, prompting the central government to enforce new restrictions on "excessive entertainment," which only goes to show that even authoritarians get it right sometimes.

Your editorial of April 15 regarding incoming SuperintendentS. Dallas Dance("Assessing Mr. Dance") states that he was selected through a "completely closed process."

The Kandahar killings made headlines around the world, but in the days just before and afterward, more than a dozen other Afghan noncombatants were killed or wounded in war-related circumstances.

The card got a major public boost in 1991, when hockey legend Wayne Gretzky and then-Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall paid $451,000 for the highest-graded Wagner card in existence, an "8."

Chile prepared for the shift by building up a budget surplus, and it has still had to borrow a sizable amount to cover the shortfall in revenue in the public pension system. The U.S. government, by contrast, has been running enormous deficits and will have to increase the public debt by trillions just to pay the Social Security benefits owed baby boomers.

And then there are those sodas. One-fourth of American teens drink an average of four sodas a day, which is the equivalent of an entire extra meal in terms of calories. Sodas, as well as energy drinks and flavored water, have no nutritional value and are often loaded with sugar. With a 90 percent profit margin on their products, the soft drink industry can spend millions on hyperactive advertising. Juice? Sounds great, except that juice isn't anywhere near as healthy as it's cracked up to be because it contains a lot of sugar and the most healthful part of the fruit itself - the fiber - has been filtered out.

Just think of what she's asked to do—keep us constantly connected to a seethingly angry, chain-smoking, kick-boxing, foul-mouthed, bisexual Goth hacker with a history of violence that she frequently and ferociously updates.

At 12,095 feet, the top of the pass is well above tree line: This is what it means to be in tundra. This narrow road usually closes in September and opens in late May.

The FCC said late Friday that it would fine Google $25,000 for obstructing its investigation of the search giant's Street View service.

In campaign mode, Gingrich is the polar opposite of Mitt Romney. Reportedly a bit shy, Romney, nevertheless, dives in, shakes every hand, signs every autograph, banters with everyone and smiles, smiles, smiles. It may be rehearsed and straight from some “How to Succeed in Politics” primer, but he’s as good at it as any TV game show host.
While many postseason expectations raised as the history piled up -- U-M's first Big Ten title since 1986, threatening a home undefeated season for the first time since the mid-1970s, the best of nearly everything else since 1998 -- that simply sharpened the disappointment.
But here in Chicago it's full steam ahead for the Walter E. Smithe furniture empire, which has been wise about establishing close bonds with consumers in the Chicago market via a series of amusing TV commercials that have aired over the years.

Domino's push to improve the reputation of its pizzas began about two years ago, when the company overhauled the recipe for its basic pie with a new sauce (more red pepper), cheese (shredded, not cubed) and crust (now with garlic flavor). It also launched an in-your-face ad campaign showing customers in focus groups dissing the subpar ingredients of the past. One said the marinara sauce tasted like ketchup.

The drug lord financed public housing and other Medellin public works and made a successful run for Congress. But after he ordered the 1984 killing of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, who had threatened to extradite Escobar to face U.S. drug-trafficking charges, the state declared war. By the time he was hunted down and killed in Medellin in December 1993, the armed forces had controlled his beloved Napoles for two years.
Regardless of jobs created, the city will not realize the increased property taxes for decades. Does up to $33 million cost justify the possible jobs and development? I don't believe so.
Fortunately, councilmen Scott Wagner and John Sharp recognized deficiencies in the original ordinance that would have made it illegal for any minor to be out in public during school hours.

Former soldiers described their anguish in attacking civilians and their homes. "It was a horrible thing," said Rodi, a former soldier who said he had been based in Homs. "At the beginning, people in Homs were just going out and asking for their freedom and a change of government. The government started the shooting. After they killed a lot of people, people stood and continued protesting. We started shelling them."

This morning, Whitaker referred to the woman as a prostitute in her cross-examination of Kleem.
Surfers tend to be a low-key lot, downplaying everything from their accomplishments to the size of the waves, all for the good graces of humility. Most every longtime Northern California surfer has known the terror of seeing a shark within point-blank range, and I'm definitely among them; my experience came at Montara, some 15 years ago, a clear-as-day shark skimming through the face of an approaching wave, backlit in the afternoon sun. A friend and I were alone in the lineup, bodysurfing, and we rode a high-adrenaline buzz in a cartoonishly rapid swim for the beach.

"It's a very, very narrow window," said Chris Dicus, professor of wildland fire fuels management at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, Calif.

When the 2011 Legislature convened, lobbyists from the UO Foundation and for the Oregon University System battled for separate bills.
The help cannot come too soon. Casinos are selling at fire-sale prices. Within the past year, The Tropicana, Resorts and Trump Marina have all sold for about 10 cents on the dollar from their values of just a few years ago.

Q: Hey, Tony: Second time in a big game I have watched LaVon Brazill of Ohio University and come away impressed. He seems to be a playmaker. Recently it feels in the NFL there has been a stream of Mid-American Conference wide receivers. Isn't he worth a consideration late? -- Jeff, NYC

Note: Pitching coach Nate Yeskie on Tuesday entered into a guilty plea for his March 27 DUII, reckless driving and reckless endangering charges. Assistant District Attorney Chris Stringer of Benton County said that Yeskie will have 12 months to complete a diversion program; If Yeskie completes the program and stays out of legal trouble the charge will be dropped. "It's important to understand that this is not a conviction," Stringer said. "A diversion program is pretty routine." Yeskie must also pay $458 in fines and assessment.

Nevermind the message on the grain silo across from the Rose Garden -- the whole RISE WITH US thing -- because Portland is only the 12th youngest team in the league anymore. That slogan has a photograph of the team's hands in the huddle and the words including "passion" and "pride" and "perseverance" all around it.
The Bulls failed to score on 12 of their next 13 possessions, scoring two points in just less than nine minutes of an 18-2 76ers' run. John Lucas III's 3-pointer with 43.1 seconds left stopped the bleeding, pulling the Bulls within 75-74.
There is room for compromise. Perhaps the size of the extension or of the proposed 3.25 percent surtax could be lowered. There is ample room in the federal budget for cuts in spending, too. But we've been down this road of negotiations several times this year, from supercommittee hearings to plain old leadership summits, and it never turns out well.

Going strong: The genetic research done in Scripps Health's Wellderly Study seeks to understand why some folks remain physically healthy and mentally alert into their 9th and 10th decades while others don't. If Scripps needs more guinea pigs, it might be wise to look inward. Two physicians long associated with Scripps, well up in their 80s, are still practicing medicine: John Carson and David Roseman, both 85. A third, Herman Froeb, 87, is recently retired, but still sees the occasional patient . . . Yes, the new Cremolose restaurant has taken the Gaslamp Quarter space relinquished in 2006 by San Diego Hardware after 114 years.

A few days later my shipment arrived, taped with fancy patterns, of course. But instead of decorating boxes (been there, done that), I used the same concept to brighten up a plain white side table. Pretty packages do come in all shapes and sizes.
David Steele, FanHouse: "The No. 1-vs.-No. 16 matchup almost never lives up to the public's wishes for even the chance of the upset of all upsets. There's pretty much the Princeton-Georgetown game in 1989 and Michigan State-Murray State overtime thriller in 1990, and the rest over the last quarter-century-plus were not all that close after awhile. In the Consol Energy Center on Thursday, with three-quarters of the 18,927 in attendance cheering on the underdogs, Asheville nearly made such support pay off."
As the metal snakes through the machine, the press pushes down on the sheet, cutting out parts and bending them into the proper shape. Think of a baker cutting biscuits out of a large roll of dough. Only imagine that happening with enough force to rip through sheets of steel.
This is sort of a partially deconstructed Cesar salad, heavy on the anchovies and Parmesan cheese. The secret is to use high-quality, olive-oil packed anchovy fillets. The romaine leaves can be separated the day before the party and kept chilled until just before assembling and serving. The anchoiade can be made a day before as well, but bring it to room temperature and mix well before assembling.

Likewise, what is Romney's view on the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which established domestic violence and stalking as federal crimes and provided funding for services for victims? Republicans in Congress are holding up reauthorization of the measure because of protections it would add for undocumented immigrants and gay men and lesbians.
On Friday, Transamerica's remodeled digs smelled like a new car and were empty save for workers planning the move. Craig Gallagher, a senior architect with Aegon, huddled with colleagues — though not in a huddle room — as they prepped for the "controlled chaos" of filling 340 workspaces with office equipment still sitting in Transamerica's leased building on Park Avenue.
The Titanic may have been the largest ship of its day, but San Francisco artist Steven J. Backman has shrunk it to the size of a toothpick.
Logging all of this data on a fleet of heavy equipment may seems obsessive. But consider that a single tire on any of dozens of the company's 400-ton trucks costs $50,000.
For agricultural employers, though, the biggest concern is whether they'll be required to cover seasonal workers, whom Pacific Northwest growers depend on heavily for their labor-intensive fruit and vegetable crops. The law excludes seasonals -- defined as working 120 days or fewer in a calendar year -- from being counted toward the threshold of 50 full-time-equivalent employees that brings employers under the insurance mandate. But a new Congressional Research Service analysis says the law requires employers over that threshold to cover seasonals during the months they are working full-time or pay the penalty.
Craig Kimbrel gave up one run in the ninth before earning his eighth save. Tabata hit a one-out double, advanced to third on McCutchen's groundout and scored on Kimbrel's wild pitch. Kimbrel struck out Garrett Jones to end the game.
This year, zydeco master Tom Rigney has been named 2011 Emperor of the Jubilee. He and his band Flambeau have been festival favorites for the past seven years.

Excerpt: If you’re a team with return issues but a top-flight offense? Then you’re in luck: those five extra yards on the touchback leave you five yards closer to the end zone. Oregon might not need those five yards — not that the Ducks have return issues — but they can’t hurt, of course. For those offensively-gifted teams resigned to a poor-return-game fate, opening a series at the 25 sounds awfully appealing.
But in approving the new indictment, trial judges said they were satisfied the changes, "will not have an impact that could be considered significant upon the accused's right to be tried without undue delay."
Guess that occurred to them too. The New York press conference on Wednesday was called off.

Norm Champ, deputy director of the SEC office that examines advisers, concedes that there is some regional variation.

Additionally, Giant Eagle is looking toward 2013 as a time when the company can evaluate its current grocery store location and study the possibilities of a major rehab project.
I did become far more cautious after researching and writing (and rewriting) "Over the Edge." Now every hazard leaps out at me as if in a special effects moment in a movie. I do recognize every place in the canyon where someone has died (like seeing those little crosses along the highway), usually by name of the victim. "Oh yeah," I find myself thinking, "this is where so-and-so died while trying to swim down to camp and drowned." This would seem to suggest that my personal experience might be unpleasant or terrifying as a guide, but in fact it is no different than driving in dangerous traffic where you understand the consequences of screwing up or letting your attention lapse. I love the canyon -- the whitewater and the fantastic hikes -- despite the dangers they pose. And because I know those dangers well and know how to neutralize them easily, I still enjoy immensely the beauty and treasures they offer. My safety talks to clients, however, definitely have lengthened. They used to be long. Now they are longer.
She noted that the $1.92 million was not a figure requested by the industry. "That was not our number, that was what 12 regular folks rendered," she said of the jury, adding that the industry remains open to settling the case with Thomas-Rasset.

SwishScout.com: "The one area of his game where he is consistently solid is on the boards where his tremendous length allows him to snatch any board in the vicinity, and really excels on the offensive boards for getting put backs out of pure effort. While he possesses a solid motor, he doesn’t really do a great job of establishing great post position on either end yet due to a lack of strength, but his rebounding should improve substantially once he does add that muscle and will be able to hold down a spot in the paint."
Knowledgeable Republicans have good arguments on many issues that are worth debating. But in order to elect officials who believe in these tenets, they have accepted the help of people with ideas that have nothing to do with rational discussion.
Peters exits the show in order to fulfill her prior concert engagements. But the rest of the Main Stem's principal cast -- Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein, Ron Raines and Elaine Paige -- will all follow the show to the west coast.
A: Let me address that issue. This is the first time that I've ever worked for a strong-mayor form of government. Usually what you see when a new mayor comes in, the police chief goes and the fire chief goes and a lot of the department heads. I understand that. If you're not a good fit then the mayor has every right and should replace you with somebody else. So the new mayor will decide. I would stay if I was asked to stay.
Columbia Police Chief Ken Burton offered an even more blunt assessment: "When they're constantly changing the chemical makeup, we'll be constantly chasing our tails."
It sure doesn't seem so. Bennett feigned melancholy while singing the lyric, "Somehow, once upon a time never comes again." But another lyric he sang might be more his mantra: "The best is yet to come." Bennett is always looking ahead. The audience laughed when he dedicated "The Good Life" to Lady Gaga, but it was no joke. "We just made a record together," he added. "Wait'll you hear it."
Instead of rolling out a list of new goals, Christie said he is sticking with the ones that have already turned Trenton upside down: Revamping education, reforming benefits for public employees, getting tough on state finances.

The team is 20-23, it has lost seven of the last nine games, and McMillan has made some glaring and stubborn mistakes in handling this veteran group. But not a single one of the executives I spoke with thought that Portland would fire McMillan after seeing what the Blazers were doing at the deadline. Not one. And in the end, we learn on a day like Thursday that the only vote that counts belongs to the owner.
"Absolute elation,'' she said of her feelings.
Just how much of an impact the outreach campaign is having, however, is unclear.
Gay marriage isn't currently legal in Maryland — legislation allowing it was recently signed by Gov.Martin O'Malley, but it doesn't take effect until next year. In the meantime, the court is being forced to decide whether it can dissolve a marriage that the state doesn't recognize. By hearing the case, Maryland's judiciary assumed a power that threatens the historic concept of divorce.
"I happened to be watching Thursday Night Football for some reason," Washburn said. "I must have been really bored wathching Mississippi State play somebody. And I saw him and I called a friend of mine and I said, `who is this guy, number 94,?' And he said, `Fletcher Cox, he's just a junior.' And I thought, `whoah.' "
"I was ready and the girls were ready," said DeMarse, who allowed only five hits and two walks with four strikeouts in six innings. "I knew it was going to be a different ballgame today. And it was. We came up short. But it was definitely better than the last two games."

The bright yellow car was discovered inside Wade's Richmond storage locker on April 28 after sheriff's sleuths connected him to a shooting two weeks prior of a girl Wade apparently liked and the teen she was dating. Neither was struck during the April 13 attack in Mill Valley even though five shots were fired into their pickup truck. Sheriff's detectives say Wade, dressed in black and riding a motorcycle, had been waiting for the couple to emerge from the male victim's Mill Valley home.
Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325º. Toast the hazelnuts on a tray until fragrant and lightly colored, about 15 minutes.

The second holiday compilation from surfer-turned-songwriter Jack Johnson's music label is a typically laid-back affair with a bevy of sun-kissed acoustic ballads (including Johnson's "In the Morning" and Neil Halstead's "Home for the Season") and a number of songs that don't sound much like Christmas tunes at all (Money Mark's "Make Time," Matt Costa's "I Bet on Flying High"). The best part? Local band Rogue Wave turns in a psychedelic pop take on "Jingle Bell Rock."

In defeat, Bodemeister’s performance was the talk of the backstretch yesterday morning, having set blistering fractions and carrying on to deep stretch before I’ll Have Another got to him late. The Baffert-trained colt outran brilliant sprinter Trinniberg to grab pacesetting honors while posting stunning fractions of :22.32, :45.39 and 1:09.80 for six furlongs — fractions that would have proven suicidal for most horses in the grueling 11⁄4-mile route. Just when most spectators expected him to tire, Bodemeister re-broke to sprint clear by three lengths in mid-stretch. The 4-1 favorite’s strides finally did shorten with a sixteenth of a mile to go, and I’ll Have Another had enough of a kick left to overtake him near the wire.

That makes the AP total slightly different in most cases from the total reported by companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I ran for President because I believed that this kind of economy was unsustainable – for the middle-class and for our nation's future. I ran because I had a different idea about how America was built – an idea rooted in my own family's story. You see, Michelle and I are where we are today because even though our families didn't have much, they worked tirelessly – without complaint – so that we might have a better life. My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II and my grandmother worked in factories on the home front. I had a single mom who put herself through school, and would wake before dawn to make sure I got a decent education. Michelle can still remember her father heading out to his job as a city worker long after Multiple Sclerosis had made it impossible for him to walk without crutches.

Six months out, it's a tie.
Why have the results of China's record-breaking production of new opera houses and concert halls been so visually striking and so functionally uneven? The multipurpose "Grand Theaters" built as the centerpieces of China's instant new cities and new business districts have been conceived less as finely tuned music venues, along Western lines, than as nationalistic symbols featuring propagandistic displays and popular Italian operas and Broadway musicals. Are they now moving toward more sophisticated artistic and musical performance and management? Ms. Newhouse thinks so, citing Ms. Hadid's recent Guangzhou Opera House, two extraordinary, rocklike structures in contrasting white and black marble inspired by stones in a nearby riverbed, where equal attention has been paid to design and acoustics. And there are still more to come from a list of international architectural superstars.

1. Quinn should be a weapon in the Spagnuolo system. Spags is a master at concocting a pass rush. He's among the best in the NFL in coming up with ways to hassle the QB. Spags needs to have a good supply of rushers. It's the life blood to his system. The more pass rushers he has, the more imposing his system will be. And Quinn -- according to every pre-draft report I've read -- is a potentially spectacular edge rusher. I haven't seen one credible draft expert 'diss Quinn's pass-rush skills. They have other concerns -- can he handle the point of attack on runs? -- but no one disputes his ability to get after the QB. Spags can have a lot of fun messing with offensive coordinators as he moves Quinn around, aiming him at the pocket. And you cannot assess this pick without putting it into the context of how Quinn will be utilized by Spagnuolo and defensive coordinator Ken Flajole. It isn't just that Quinn is a pass rusher; he is a pass rusher that is joining a team with a HC who maximizes the ability of a pass rusher.

Which brings us around to George. He is the weak link in this otherwise terrific novel. While both he and Amina hide tangled and complex past relationships, it is Amina, her desires, secrets, fears, prejudices, embarrassments, and cruelties that keep us reading.

The two started a friendship, continued to communicate and the woman's story intrigued Freudenberger enough to travel to Bangladesh and meet her family and, with the woman's permission, to write the novel.

A Different Pointe of View at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort was the big-daddy wine buyer at the time. There were essentially three main wine distributors, and in order to get anything unique or special, we all had to direct, import or clear wines through them.

If you want straight whiskey in the new Louisville, the Silver Dollar is the place. Dozens of whiskeys (and tequilas) line the shelves behind the bar, and they arrive both in an ambitious cocktail list and on their own. Silver Dollar fashions itself a modern honky-tonk, featuring a large American flag across a brick wall (likely more for the motif than patriotism), country music spinning from a turntable and barbecue in the kitchen. It attracts a young and boisterous crowd. Think of it as Meat's fun younger brother. (1761 Frankfort Av.; 1-502-259-9540; www.whiskey bythedrink.com)

Many people, myself included, picked Cena to win this contest, so when he failed to kick out at the end, I personally was shocked. The thought of The Rock winning was always in the back of my mind, but I didn't imagine it would be a perfectly clean 1-2-3 in the middle of the ring.
How off-the-mark is the opinion? It has bonded together the most unusual of political bedfellows: Our gun-toting, libertarian-leaning Republican land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, and one of the most liberal, yellow-dog Democrats ever to serve in the Texas Legislature, former Sen. Babe Schwartz. Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott said the court's premise was built on nothing more solid than, well, shifting sands. It's supported by "nothing," Abbott said.

In this endearingly saloon-like seafood hangout, the dozen choices of oysters on the half-shell are mostly from the Northwest and Canada, but everything else carries the bracing bite of Louisiana. That means gumbos, po' boy sandwiches, jambalaya and even gator bites, and New Orleans cocktails with a big choice of bourbons. The serious spicing of the cuisine is set off by the ease of the atmosphere and the price structure -- nothing is over $15.

Be cool yourself: "Bees are defensive, not aggressive ... and they also gorge on honey before they leave the hive, because they don't know when they're going to get groceries again. So they're kind of fat and happy, too." Don't spray a swarm with water or insecticide or throw rocks. Roughly a third of the human diet is honeybee-pollinated, Conrey says — and bee populations are still suffering 30 to 40 percent losses in population every year.

It appears Cudi is headed down a rabbit hole of Marshall half-stacks and psychedelic rock, and tracks such as “Marijuana” and other stand-outs from his criminally slept-on second album could very well become mere artifacts. And it’s a shame, because the progression from his first album to second was vast and encouraging and even hinted his rap style could still grow into something sharper. Instead, we wait with skepticism and trepidation for the next leak from an album we probably won’t want or need. Strange, indeed.

And his hypnotic, almost demonic "Jose Marti" is a portrait study of the great 19th-century Cuban poet and political philosopher.

While UV-A has lower energy, it does penetrate deep into the eye and may injure the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sight in the center field of vision.

It’s not meant to confuse you, but sometimes jargon known as “educationese” or “edspeak” can be a head-scratcher. Acronyms such as SES, AYP and IEP are thrown around too often in education. (That’s socioeconomic status, adequate yearly progress and individualized education program.)

Hotel Maya, 700 Queensway Drive, Long Beach, CA 90802; (562) 435-7676, http://www.hotelmayalongbeach.com. Can this boutique lodging really be part of the Hilton empire?

"Each school district will have a year to work through that process, and I will tell you, it is a process," Hildick said. "In every district, student achievement is on the table ... but it's subtle.

Truth to tell, with Ned gone, the second season is slightly more difficult to fathom at first because Ned provided a kind of through-line, since he had the job of being the king's hand and was more of a family man, compared with some of the more barbaric tribes. We got to know Ned, his wife, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), and their kids. Now, with Ned gone, it's up to eldest son Robb (Richard Madden) to seek justice for his father's death.
The personification of these Royals so far is Eric Hosmer, busting with promise and often crushing big-league pitching while trying to get out of his head that he's hitting around .200 for a fan base that expected so much more. This is a talented group, much better than how it has played, but so far the team has been an undeniable buzzkill to what was supposed to be a fun summer.

Q: How did you go from city engineer to community development director?
Portland lacked consistency. It failed to play a complete quarter in any of the six games of this series. Rooting for this team sucked fans emotionally dry like a weekday afternoon soap opera. And even as I watched frustrated Blazers players leave the tunnel for the final game this season, and fans look sick about it, I'm convinced Portland didn't deserve to play another game.
Occasionally, the ownership of an asset transcends the owner's immediate interest in that asset. When a property becomes more valuable and important to a broader population than just the owner, the owner incurs obligations to a larger audience, whether or not he recognizes it.

Lipstick used to be a spontaneous pick-me-up. Leonard Lauder coined the idea of a Lipstick Index a decade ago to show how lipstick sales rise in a bad economy.

There is the Tuscany Club, pretty much a pure nightclub. There is Florentine's Downtown Bar and Grill, a restaurant that turns into a club. There is the Palapa Grill, which resembles a Polynesian grass shack. And then there is a tiny bar generally referred to as the "poolroom bar." It has a single pool table because there isn't room for more than one. But it always has a pretty good crowd who apparently like the no-frills ambience.

* The Rams, as expected, rejected the CVC's initial plan to spruce up The Edward Jones Dome. The key words being: as expected. So let's hope the Chicken Littles among the fringe media and some of the more hysterical fans can hold off from rushing into the streets in an instantaneous state of full-blown arousal. Please remain calm. Please refrain from fear mongering. Please take sedatives if it helps. This is a necessary step in the negotiating process, and nothing more. The Rams' choice to decline merely moves us closer to actual negotiations. The Rams have until May 1 to make a counteroffer to the CVC. This gives both sides time to discuss the situation, and see if they can find common ground. And if the CVC rejects the Rams' counteroffer -- as I would expect -- it's not the end of the game. I don't think anything can really be accomplished until all of these procedural datelines are out of the way. That's when the real talks will begin.

Boop is so down on gas grills, he pretty much refuses to use them. "I'd rather be a vegetarian than ruin a good piece of meat," he told me just yesterday. Look, don't pay too much attention to Boop.

Anyway, if you're stuck with gas-lava-charcoal, try using some of those expensive wood chips they sell at BBQ stores, or rip that loose board off your neighbor's fence.

No, it doesn't appear Oden will play this year, probably bringing to an end a monumental No. 1-pick nightmare for Portland, but at least the Blazers appear to finally be equipped with the right personnel and depth to control the phenom.

Yes, there's the foie gras, an enviable wine list and French influences throughout. But the vigilant orbit of chef/owner Gabriel Rucker -- the James Beard Foundation's 2011 Rising Star Chef of the Year -- makes this place. He chats up diners, picks music on Pandora and guides staff in his clean open kitchen, all while ensuring plates come out impeccably presented, crouching down close to sculpt them just so. He fields questions about the mache -- a salad of lamb's lettuce and tangy grilled celery root, mellowed by brie and almonds. He slow-roasts lamb shoulder all night before deep frying it for a carnitas-like texture on the outside, then flanks it with lemony green-garlic fennel risotto, tomatoes and strings of curried pickled fennel.

There is a pervasive myth in America that strong leaders can, through force of will, take the country in new directions. Such directors of change are rare, if they exist at all. Franklin Roosevelt came to power when the people were ready for social change, and his ideas were an extension of existing state-based reforms. When Roosevelt tried to direct change through packing the Supreme Court or intervening in Democratic congressional primaries, the public rose up and swatted him down. Ronald Reagan did not direct a conservative revolution either; he channeled and gave voice to a growing public dissatisfaction with government. Reagan got his tax and regulatory reform and his defense increases. But he never unraveled the New Deal safety net. He never brought the force of the American people into his battle against communism in Central America. Like Roosevelt, Reagan facilitated changes percolating up from the people.

A zombie, a Blue Blood and a warlock all wander into a story that toward the end reads like a crash course in Norse mythology as De la Cruz tries to pull together her plot strings and set up the next book.

How, conversely, does the Obama administration approach illegal immigration? It has suspended action against many of the 300,000 illegal immigrants who had faced deportation and cleared many of them to hold U.S. jobs.

And it proposes spending cuts for federal-state partnerships that enforce immigration law and for fencing and air surveillance on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Twitter still doesn't let its users retweet, or share someone else's tweet to their followers with their own added comment. (Some apps refer to this as quoting a tweet.) This means I can only re-share exactly what someone else posted—there's no way to include what I think of the tweet. Almost all of Twitter's apps enable adding comments in retweets. A spokeswoman for Twitter says this feature is often requested and the company is actively considering it.
In the end, we decided to split the difference: We'd take half of that $395 a month and save for college, and use the other half to prepay our mortgage. By paying an additional $195 a month (we chose the odd number because it took our $805 monthly mortgage payment to an easy-to-remember $1,000). By doing so we'll shave 47 payments off the term of our 20-year fixed-rate mortgage, saving $11,939 in interest. And in 2014, if things go as planned, Gerald and his high-school pals can join us at our mortgage-burning party.

Since then, the Neptune-raised Atkins has completely turned over her band, ditching the Sea in favor of a fresh outfit.

Electric guitarist Irina Yalkowsky, one of her new support musicians, sat by her side on a stage built into the store’s back wall. Atkins strummed an acoustic, and sang like a woman with something to prove.
Mechanical harvesting works well for the thicker-skinned Bordeaux grapes of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, says John Clews, Clos Du Val vice president for vineyard and winery operations. His winery is the rare Napa winery to invest heavily in mechanical harvesting, gradually increasing the number of acres harvested mechanically for the last 20 years. Clews sees a quality advantage because the grapes, de-stemmed by the machine in the field, can be processed more quickly in the winery.

between the fish and rice balls, leaving slices of red snapper and tuna especially bland. Not all was for naught, however. I liked the smoky, salty flavor of the cured mackerel, and I thought the shrimp tempura roll was a step up from the usual fake-crab California option. Being from Pennsylvania, I have a weakness for an occasional Philadelphia roll (smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber). The Mr. Sushi roll uses unsmoked salmon and swaps avocado and asparagus for the cucumber. What can I say? It works.

There are no absolutes here. For one thing, there isn't a single umbrella way for any journalist to do a thorough background search on any subject. Years of police procedural TV shows have led many viewers to believe computer database searches of criminal histories and fingerprints are instantaneous and definitive, but that's an almost laughably fictionalized version of how actual criminal records searches work.

When we exited the elevator on the fourth floor, we were greeted with a lobby for patients and visitors, a consultation room, and a long white expanse of hallway. Everything is white — the floors, ceilings, doorways, and walls; everything is spotlessly clean and hospital-like .

1:09 -- TOUCHDOWN -- The Giants add another score on a 10-yard pass from Manning to Bradshaw, but the drive was fueled by Henry Hynoski, who had 3 catches on the drive and a hurdle over Terence Newman. Yes, the same Terence Newman who Bear Pascoe leaped over in the first quarter. If it's not Newman's worst game, it's at least his most embarrassing. Those two guys aren't exactly leapers. The extra point makes it 21-0, Giants. That's the biggest lead the Giants have had since...well, it's the biggest lead the Giants have had this season. So for the first time, we'll see the Giants play with a comfortable lead this early in a game. And it couldn't have come at a bigger time.

Since moving to St. Louis in 1995 the Rams have made a series of risky coaching hires. Their first HC, Oregon's Rich Brooks, was pulled from the college ranks. Steve Ortmayer, the GM at the time, made the hire because team president John Shaw was consumed by negotiating the Rams' move from Los Angeles to St. Louis. Brooks was and is a good football man, but the NFL didn't fit him well. After winning his first four games as Rams coach, Brooks went 9-19, lost control of the locker room, and was fired after the 1996 season.

Loaded question. It is both rewarding and challenging. The reward is to actually see people's lives change positively, to see their faith stretched and increased, to see minds and attitudes change.

Watch for Facebook "like" scams. Facebook will generally alert you via a pop-up window and ask you to confirm your actions if it is not confident in a link you are accessing. If you have already mistakenly clicked on a link that added to your "likes and interests" on Facebook, you will need to edit your interests on your profile and remove any links to spam sites you may have acquired. Do this by selecting "edit my profile" by your profile image. Next, click "likes and interests" and remove anything suspicious. If you see something strange coming from the Facebook account of someone else, you know what I'm going to say: be a "Facebook friend" in the best sense and let the account-holder know.

Fortunately, the Ehrlichs survived; we also took note as our elected leaders promised that "never again" would an OPEC cartel impose its will on a defenseless America; "never again" would hostile regimes be able to inflict such damage on the world's most vibrant economy.

A leaking roof is perfect for what's happening, right? The slow, relentless disintegration of hope, optimism, faith in what's right and fair. That sinking feeling things will get worse before they get better. I don't care that rain made this place -- the blessed forests, the fertile fields, the brilliant blooms. I don't find it comforting. I hate it from the bottom of my cold, wet heart.

The legislative response to the funding loss was to grow even more serious Monday with Sen. Majority Leader Barbara Buono’s plan for the Senate to take the rare step of granting itself the power to subpoena records and testimony from administration officials.

But Beck, a former Ravens backup, struggled again in his third start. He couldn't find receivers deep, he led receivers over the middle poorly (getting picked off on one such throw) and only had success on short screen and dump-off passes to rookie running back Roy Helu, who had 14 catches, a total that broke the team record for receptions in a game, a mark that had been held by Art Monk and Kelvin Bryant.

A: My 13-year-old daughter does the same thing. This mostly happens after she visits her dad. He and I are divorced, and he just started dating. Once we noticed that she seemed to be very reserved around family members, teachers and friends upon returning from her weekends with her dad, yet exploding at home and school over trivial incidents, I called the school counselor and asked her to talk with my daughter. Basically the counselor said that my daughter still had high hopes of her dad and I getting back together and blamed herself for it not happening. Seeing her dad with a different woman destroyed this dream. It took several counseling sessions and the follow through to assure her that her dad and I were not recovering our relationship and that it had nothing to do with her. We both have tried very hard to make sure that she knows that we respect one another and love her very much. If you can't get the answers you need from your daughter about why she is doing this, have her talk to the school counselor or another professional who might help you figure out what is going on and what you can do to help her correct the problem. - Suzie Hampton in Pensacola, Fla.

Entrees bordered on excellent, marred by a few details. Risotto primavera ($17), for example, features well-prepared rice, with a nice sauce from the starchy grains pooled around the edges, but the vegetables mixed in were clumsy.

Wiener ran in and picked up our pizzas at Broadway Pizza (56 Broadway, Paterson; 973-684-9407) as the Munchmobile driver held down a more-or-less legal parking spot nearby. It wasn’t worth the effort. The plain had a lackluster crust, and the sausage was subpar — and that’s being kind.

Those who understand Nathan's positions, reflect on his record, and listen to his words know exactly what his move to the middle meant. The move was a reflection of the values he has consistently held and the progress he is hoping to make. Nathan has always been independent in his actions, regardless of party affiliation. He chose to weigh the value of every issue on its merit, rather than resort to party dogma and group think. It is never easy when one decides to think for themselves and risk upsetting the political establishment, but that's exactly why San Diego needs Nathan Fletcher as mayor. – Jason Pyle, Founder, Sapphire Energy, San Diego

The bane of his existence is his 90ish mother (Valeria de Franciscis Bendoni), deeply tanned no doubt from the many poker games she plays with her peers in the garden of her luxurious house. She has all the money. Gianni lives on a pension and his wife's income, and grits his teeth as his mother serves champagne to her poker buddies and buys designer gowns for her caregiver. His marriage is peaceful and his wife affectionate, but seems focused elsewhere.

Holzer's introduction is worth the price of admission: He allows his readers to sense the behind-the-scenes conversations that produced these remarkable first-person essays. The editors knew that the biggest general to catch was Grant. The general and ex-president turned away their opening overture, but with the failure of Grant & Ward on Wall Street in 1884, resulting in the loss of all of Grant's assets, he agreed to write an essay on Shiloh for $500. The present editors include four of Grant's Century essays. Reading them here allows us to understand why Grant's "Personal Memoirs," completed in 1885 as he was dying from throat cancer, became the surprising standard for all future presidential memoirs.

If the NFL ever eliminates the kickoff, a truly exciting play that represents the essence of the sport, it will have gone too far on the safety issue. Otherwise, every new rule gets hearty applause from here. In the face of current and imminent lawsuits, rumored to be in the thousands, the NFL will do everything in its power to reduce and monitor concussions, including a program that would keep track of every retired player, many of them too proud to take measures on their own or admit to any brand of vulnerability.

Hype didn’t overwhelm Niese in the minors. He grew up in Defiance, a town of about 16,000 in northwestern Ohio located a little more than an hour south of Toledo.

They also caught sight of Niese, a slinky lefty, a sophomore throwing fastballs in the mid-80s.

Giving individuals the same tax breaks for health insurance that corporations get, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, a modicum of tort reform and the expansion of health savings accounts would have done a great deal to improve quality and reduce costs.

The recent discussions between the company and Feinberg illustrate how politically sensitive the bonuses have become, both for AIG and for the Obama administration. No development in the government's bailout of financial firms has angered lawmakers and ordinary Americans more than the disclosure in mid-March that the global insurer was paying more than $165 million in retention bonuses. Those were aimed at retaining 400 employees at AIG Financial Products, the troubled unit whose complex derivative contracts nearly wrecked the global insurance giant.

The paper by the scholars from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College is detailed and runs through several scenarios. I want to highlight what I thought was an especially telling set of numbers. For the median wage earner -- and assuming a rate of return on assets of 4 percent in their 401(k) and IRA -- starting to save at age 25 rather than age 45 cuts the required savings rate for an adequate retirement income by about two-thirds. However, delaying retirement from age 62 to age 70 also reduces the required savings rate by some two-thirds.

Donald Warnke, Stevensville: Nov. 10, 1963. Anyone over 10 years old will remember the date. I was in history class at Denby High School. The excitement for us that day was that Denby was scheduled to play Notre Dame High in the annual Goodfellow game at Briggs Stadium that night. It was more than just Public League vs. Catholic League. Both schools were undefeated, both Class A. The winner would be voted in as the state champs of Michigan.

It certainly would not be fair to the hospitals that might want to present a countervailing message to a hypothetical CNA initiative to mandate patient-to-nurse ratios. It certainly would not be fair to insurance companies or doctors' groups that might want to present their side to an attempt by the CNA to ask voters to approve a government-run health-care system -- which, some suspect, is the hidden agenda of Proposition 89.
Mallory has come to invite Grant (Michael Gabriel Goodfriend) to serve as the climb’s official artist and photographer. A horrified Bell is quick to point out that the painter is “an entirely domesticated animal.”
Now, as the state's chief elections officer, Husted suggests some modifications, most notably shrinking the voting window to three weeks.

Could there be an actor more perfectly suited for Samuel Beckett’s works than John Hurt? Not only does his gaunt face and wiry hair recall the playwright, but he has the ravaged look of a man haunted by memories too painful to contemplate.

Vaughan and Drew Goddard, a former "Buffy" TV staff writer who wrote the sleeper hit movie, "Cloverfield" and is co-executive producer of the TV series, "Lost."

The legislation was stopped Wednesday -- but barely. To pass, the amendment needed 60 votes; only 54 senators voted for it. Still, it's alarming that a majority of senators were prepared to back the banks against consumers, and it doesn't bode well for the future. Banks are already warning that they will raise other fees, such as those for checking accounts, to make up for the lost income. And it's not looking as if we can count on our elected officials to keep them honest.
When the first officers arrived, the report said, the student released Davis, who was "unresponsive."

øIf they didn't want to be at their best for the team, you would think they would be fully invested in the idea that having the best possible playoff run was best for both of their careers.

Obama has made it clear that he is serious about reducing the number of U.S. troops -- and, even if that weren't his starting point, he faces pressure from within his own party to begin a drawdown soon. The most immediate danger to Obama's re-election would be a primary challenge from the left by Feingold or some other disenchanted dove, and the president would like to head that off. By comparison, criticism from the right could actually help him; the Afghan conflict is deeply unpopular, and Obama might benefit from casting his Republican opponents as champions of a bigger, longer, more expensive war.

John Freeman, editor of the literary journal "Granta," believes "there is no art form which can compress a dynamic so complex into a single narrative or a form." Like Junod, he credits nonfiction writers for "beginning to grasp the long context of these events, and how it is so much bigger than New York City or Osama bin Laden." But he also defends "Falling Man," DeLillo's brief novel set in part at ground zero on the very day, as the "one book which captures the eye of the storm."
Groves is urging cities and states to promote the census and improve upon rates in 2000, when about 72 percent of U.S. households returned their forms. If everyone who receives a census form mails it back, the government would save an estimated $1.5 billion in follow-up visits.

Given the mind-boggling complexity of the possibilities, Higdon's achievement in her concerto is considerable, with deft handling of tone color, texture and rhythmic transitions in a unified piece that flows easily in a rush of uninterrupted energy over a single 23-minute movement.

øInstead of giving players a selection of mini-games to explore, Rhythm Heaven Fever opens with just one mini-game. It's a golfing game about timing your swing to hit golf balls that are tossed to you. The balls lobbed by the little monkey are easy to hit; but instead of just letting you warm up this way, the mini-game also introduces "fast balls" thrown by a mandrill monkey and interchanges these two pitchers. Achieving the passing score needed to unlock the next game will probably take repeated practice; so you will want to steel yourself to frequently see the "Try Again" screen. And there is no progress bar on the screen to let you know how you are doing.

Jeff Barker: There sure were a lot more memorable moments for the defense than the offense during the spring game. It looked like the stronger unit. I like the defensive line with Joe Vellano and A.J. Francis returning. The linebackers could be strong in the new 3-4, particularly if Kenny Tate can come back from knee surgery. “Depth-wise, the safety position is where we need some help,” defensive coordinator Brian Stewart said recently. The fans had to be rattled by watching the offensive line surrender 13 sacks. You just don’t expect your quarterbacks to be so harrassed in a spring game. It may be driving Randy Edsall crazy that people keep asking him about the dozen Maryland players who left the program after last season. Here’s how a reporter phrased a question during the most recent ACC teleconference: “How concerned are you that you could experience some growing pains or difficulties at quarterback in the fall when Danny O'Brien's out there leading Wisconsin to another Rose Bowl?” Think the ball coach loved that question? His reply: “I'm just concerned aboutC.J. Brown and Perry Hills and Caleb Rowe.”

Two other musicals  "The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess" and "Nice Work If You Can Get It"  each got 10 nominations as the Tony committee spread the wealth. Unlike last year's "The Book of Mormon," no monster single hit dominated the nominations.

"It's a damn long ways over there," said Harrington, who may skip the procession that some trainers say makes for an indelible Derby memory. "My main focus is being able to perform in the paddock and get the saddle on him. If the horse gets there 20 minutes before I do, what good am I going to be?"
The Missouri School Boards Association supports Dieckhaus' bill because it replaces lifetime tenure for teachers with multiyear contracts, said the group's lobbyist, Mike Reid.

• "Prom" (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, rated PG, DVD $29.99; Blu-ray Combo $39.99). Hasn't "High School Musical" been here before? Anyway, the big end-of-school dance is coming, see, and when the plans for it by overachiever Nova Prescott (Aimee Teegarden) go down the drain, she must hop to work on an alternate vision with the help of an anti-social underachiever (Thomas McDonnell). Meanwhile, other students have all the usual problems with lining up dates, deciding on clothes, juggling career ambitions — you know? Of course you do. Leave this for the ones who haven't been there yet.
"If it were up to curators and museum directors around the world, we'd all get along," Komaroff said. "We recognize the importance of these cultural interchanges. I don't know if our governments always recognize it."

Unlike most of his fights, though, Mayweather looked like he had been in a fight after beating Cotto. He had welts under his both eyes and he spoke deliberately, like a fighter who was exhausted by the effort needed to capture the 43rd win of his unblemished career.

And U.S. hopeful Ryan Hall, who led more than half the race, held it together and finished fourth on Boylston Street in 2:04:58. That's more than 20 seconds faster than the course record set in 2010 and the fastest ever by a U.S. runner.
Labor Department officials didn't explain what led to the unexpectedly big upward adjustments in the data for early April, but the recent reversal of improving claims data lines up with other reports from business groups and the government that suggest a loss of some momentum in the job market.

“The organization has a teachers’ curriculum called ‘Down Jersey: Celebrating Our Sense of Place.’
But "The Trinity Six" is also solidly in-genre. Sam Gaddis is a perfect thriller character: He's handsome, smart and perhaps a tinge mysterious. "With his crooked good looks, Gaddis would have been a natural for television, but he valued his privacy too much." He's weak around beautiful and smart women and dutiful to his 5-year-old daughter. He can defend himself with a gun, but he's usually a humble Everyman who understands that people have "better things to be spending their hard-earned cash on" than his books. Yet faced with major money problems, Gaddis becomes heroic, wielding his occupation as one would a sword: "It was the only solution. He would have to work his way out of the crisis. He would have to write."
The Nationals also scored a pair of runs against Philadelphia reliever Brian Sanches in the bottom of the ninth.
On Azerbaijan, he said that progress has been made that "is in the interest of the region and the interest of the United States of America." Then he offered a classic Biden moment: "I guess what I'm trying to say without boring you too long at breakfast -- and you all look dull as hell, I might add. The dullest audience I have ever spoken to. Just sitting there, staring at me. Pretend you like me!"
The Security Council could allow another few days to negotiate the monitors' movements but if no progress is made the council will consider "other options" including economic sanctions imposed by the U.N., the diplomat said.

4. Bottlegate -- Displeasure at an overturned fourth-down conversion in the red zone in the final minute on replay led to a long delay, while beer bottles, hurled by angry fans, decorated the turf. Had Quincy Morgan either (a) caught the ball or (b) not preened and made the "first down" arm signal, the Browns would have either (a) converted or (b) got the next play off before the replay official intervened. The Jaguars won, 15-10, in 2001. Post-game discussion was enlivened by the assertion of Carmen Policy, the Browns' president, that "those bottles are plastic. They don't pack much of a wallop."

"The beef and dairy in the American food supply is safe, and USDA remains confident in the health of U.S. cattle." Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. "The systems and safeguards in place to protect animal and human health worked as planned to identify this case quickly, and will ensure that it presents no risk to the food supply or to human health. USDA has no reason to believe that any other U.S. animals are currently affected, but we will remain vigilant and committed to the safeguards in place."

A handful of teams, like USC and Penn State, are still shunning the trend for now. But Nebraska — Egads! — will wear an alternate adidas jersey at a home game this season, athletic director and former coach Tom Osborne told The Associated Press on Monday.
The companies — third-party providers of gift cards to malls, groceries and convenience stores — told The Associated Press it's too hard to comply with the changes in New Jersey's unclaimed property law. The law requires gift card sellers to obtain ZIP codes from buyers so the state can claim the value of unused cards. Without such information, the value of unused cards would revert to the company or to the state in which the company is incorporated.
We could go on. From evangelicals' general enthusiasm for an Iraq war that defied most interpretations of Christian just-war doctrine, to their support for political figures and tactics that defy all standards of decency and honesty, we see a pattern of behavior conspicuously out of step with the book they claim as their manual for living.
Turn heat to medium, cover and steam over gently simmering water for 1 hour. Check after 20 minutes and add boiling water as needed. It's important not to steam over water that is boiling too hard because the batter will rise and spill over.

Adler believes her neighborhood, which Palestinians call Silwan and Jews call the City of David, was where the biblical King David once walked and is the heart of Israel's historic capital. She is willing to brave the occasional rock-throwing and rioting that erupt in the sector - sometimes sparked by Jewish expansion moves - to remain in the place she believes is so tied to Jewish history.

There's no question payroll taxes are constitutional, because there's no doubt that the federal government can tax people in order to finance particular public benefits. But requiring citizens to buy something from a private company is different because private companies aren't directly accountable to the public. They're accountable to their owners, and their purpose is to maximize profits. What if they monopolize the market and charge humongous premiums? Some already seem to be doing this.

"The choristers' last show was Norma,' and I remember after the final performance there was a knock on my door," said Ward Holmquist, the Lyric's artistic director. "And the choristers were all standing out there and they were kind of teary and I said, What's the matter? We just closed a great show!' And they said, This is our final performance at the Lyric Theatre.' And I hadn't even thought about it."

Their one-bedroom apartment was barely big enough for two, so my son and I stayed at a hostel — another thing I never intended to do with my child. But the Circus Hostel defied my post-college experience of shacking up in cheap rooms with strangers who talked all night. The top floor of the five-story building held comfortable, IKEA-décor apartments that had views of the TV Tower, a Cold War leftover that, at 1,207 feet, remains the tallest structure in Germany.
There may come a day when asking people whether they are gay is as innocuous as asking where they live. But we're not there yet. The revelation of a judge's sexual orientation continues to spark controversy (as in the case of former Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who heard the Proposition 8 case), and questions about people's private lives are not yet routine.
"That was our best defensive quarter in a long time," Nuggets coach George Karl said. "Our energy to start the third has not been good generally. Tonight we accepted the criticism and played very well."
The daughter of sitar great Ravi Shankar, Jones exploded out of the New York City jazz scene in the early '00s and built a steady career on albums that elegantly nodded toward jazz, country and pop in a manner that merged well with public spaces seeking a hip (but not too hip) backdrop.
Yost's office found that the Columbus charter school, where Shye was treasurer, got about $100,000 from the state after it no longer had any students.

"There's definitely more awareness now," said. "Five years ago, the term was not on the radar. People don't give you a blank look anymore." Then she added: "I'm surprised how many people, even people in horticulture, think a rain garden is a water garden, a pond," she said. "Then they say they don't want a pond in their front yard."

But several council members agreed with the group that the fight against graffiti has to begin at home - and has to involve parents who aren't afraid to punish their children for doing wrong.
Most peculiar among Mickelson's career to date is that he has never achieved No. 1 in anything. He has not been No. 1 in the world ranking or on the PGA Tour money list. He has not won the FedEx Cup in its five years of existence. He has never been voted player of the year.
"He's been amazing this year," Kielbaso said. "Last year, Kyle was with him every day, so Kyle kind of took the lead. This year, Cliff knows that he's got to do it. He had a great attitude last year. But this year it's even more professional. He's here early every day, he stays late, he wants to do extra."
Kuntupis says he's remained sober since entering drug treatment shortly after his January 2007 arrest. Peals says she'd been sober for about 1 1/2 years, but had a relapse last summer because she was so depressed about the lengthy custody battle.
Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, fending off questions about whether she used her Native American heritage to advance her career, said today she enrolled herself as a minority in law school directories for nearly a decade because she hoped to meet other people with tribal roots.
3. When Luck enrolled at Houston's Memorial Middle School and went out for the football team, coaches put him at defensive end. It didn't take long for them to see the error of their ways. "The first day I showed up, they gave me lineman pads and I was probably too embarrassed to ask anyone to let me throw the ball so I could show them I could do it," Luck told the Houston Chronicle.

Whinna said police were able to identify Henning as the suspect within a half-hour of the hold-up, in part because of descriptions given. Perhaps the most telling feature was a tribal tattoo band around his neck.
"I thought it would be great if kids got to use the beds. It's better than having just grass out there," owner Lois Hankins said.
Caliche (22-4) took advantage of Springfield's futility on the way to a 38-16 halftime lead. After guard Max Duncan hit two free throws that put Springfield (18-7) up 4-2, the Longhorns converted only 6-of-39 possessions into points going into the intermission. In a stretch in the first and second quarters, the Longhorns converted only 3-of-31 possessions into points.
(She won an Obie, among other honors, for her work.) Here, Patrese D. McClain assays the enormous role with style, versatility and, let's be honest, pure nerve.
Given all that, it's clear that we're on to a growing success story - not only in California but in Washington, too. The next challenge is to make great Grenache in enough volume to become a familiar sight on shelves. But if that could be accomplished for Pinot Noir - using, let's be honest, a range of dark arts - there's no reason that easygoing Grenache can't rally where its Rhone-native siblings have struggled.

"My K-Cup is not just a solution for environmentalism," but it also allows people to buy whatever beans they like best, said Molly Kelley, a Keurig spokeswoman. Keurig's parent company, Vermont-based Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, has developed a reputation for environmental awareness and has instituted composting and solar power. A third-party certifier, Fair Trade USA, said late last year that Green Mountain is the No. 1 buyer of fair trade coffee globally.
This week, it just seemed like the natural way to do this project. I started writing it on the new iPad simply because it's part of the process of testing (and because I've found a 24 hour donut shop with incredibly good free WiFi). But as I went along, I felt no motivation to move it to my MacBook. The screen was crisp and comfortable. The 4G-speed mobile broadband gave me greater freedom of movement. I had 10 hours of battery, so I never needed to rush through my work and I never needed to hip-check that guy who seemed to be headed towards the table that adjoins the donut place's lone open power outlet.
Two of those five — in Hampstead and Ocean City — are waiting for the state comptroller to approve their brewing licenses, an agency spokeswoman said.

Every year, it seems, the story about Cleveland Public Theatre's upcoming season contains the words "most ambitious." Why mess with tradition? The 2011-12 season for Cleveland's alternative theater is the most ambitious yet, with a jam-packed schedule that includes seven world premieres, six of which are devised theater.

The value-added approach focuses on how much progress students make year to year rather than measuring solely their achievement level, like the API, which is heavily influenced by factors outside a school's control, including poverty and parental involvement. Value-added analysis compares a student with his or her own prior performance, largely controlling for outside-of-school influences.

"When you're so young, you haven't yet realized there's limitations to what humans can do. You think this 16-year-old guy sailed around the world. Why can't I? For me and my family, it was never all that shocking or that big a deal. I'd been raised around it. It was almost normal."
The straightforward Albona serves four-star dishes from the Istrian Peninsula. That strip is now part of Croatia, which explains the bottles of Terzolo vinos on the wine list and a few menu items involving sauerkraut.

"Blunderbuss," which debuted on the Billboard album charts this week at No. 1 with about 138,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan, was particularly unplanned. When the rapper RZA didn't make it to a scheduled session at White's studio, White decided to start working up some songs of his own. It wasn't until well into the process that those in the room — a collection of session musicians and others — understood the project taking shape.

"We upgraded to curtains with a string," Karen said. "It was really a big deal."
No refunds have occurred since then. But that's partly because the Hancock Amendment forced a change in public policy. In response to swelling state revenue, legislators enacted a variety of new tax breaks in the mid- to late 1990s. Then the economy dipped in the 2000s, leaving a large gap between the revenue ceiling imposed by the Hancock Amendment and Missouri's actual revenue.
The eight-shot deficit was not nearly as daunting as the 39 players ahead of him — especially McIlroy, who was only one shot back.
Joe Farrell, a Hamptons builder, says he's seen demand rise for trophy basements since he finished his 10,000-square-foot basement with a skateboard half pipe, spa, squash court and disco.

By the way, he got his Ph.D. in May, and he is already doing a lot to give back to the community.

Wacky Wacky West (Mayfair, $35; 2-4 players; age 10+; 45 min.) Ignore the strenuously cartoonish Old West theme, and there's a perfectly handsome little family game lurking here. Players lay tiles to extend the streets, railroads and the river from the corners of the board into the center of town; the goal is to keep the developers from running over the buildings you have a secret stake in. That involves a nice mix of strategy, bluffing and luck - just the right balance for intergenerational play.

To the point and businesslike, but with the potential for coquettishness.)

And be prepared to see Dunham, who looks nothing like the women we see in most TV shows. That is to say, she might pass muster as the nerdy gal-pal in a traditional sitcom. But when was the last time we saw the lead female character in a TV show -- comedy or drama -- look so average? Dunham's not skinny. She doesn't appear to have had a nose job, Botox or lip injections. All of her body parts -- and we get a good look at them -- appear to be factory originals.

The Blazers coaches and players talked after Game 6 about how "draining" the season was. How "emotional" things felt. How they worked hard, and battled, and struggled together. And as they talked about these things I wondered if they realized who it was they'd forgotten.

As a writer and preacher I rely on the power of words, but as a priest I sometimes have to be reminded that music, gesture, and ritual are just as important--arguably even more important--to the experience of worship. It is possible to talk all the mystery away, and when the mystery is gone, so too is our experience of sacredness, prayerfulness, and awe.

As he guided his boat across the surface of Cross Lake, state conservation officer Cary Shoutz studied the lakeshore house in front of him. It was 6,900 square feet of living space crammed on a 23,000-square-foot lot with a lawn sprawling downhill. "The elevation is going to drain all the runoff into this channel here," said Shoutz, a 22-year veteran of Minnesota's lakeside enforcement wars. "It's legal. But it would have been nice if they could have left natural growth near the water and built a catch basin for the runoff. ... They had a chance here to do something really special, and we didn't get the message to them, obviously."

Your dentist can evaluate whether bleaching is right for your teeth, since different kinds of discoloration respond differently to whitening. For example, bleaching works for most stains caused by age, smoking, and regular coffee or tea drinking, but it may not be effective against discoloration that results from tetracycline use in children under age 8. (Tooth discoloration can also occur in a child whose mother took tetracycline while pregnant.) Finally, even if you choose the over-the-counter route, your dentist can advise you on the relative merits of the products available.

The orchestra, to these ears, sounded much the same as it did in the Georg Solti years. That is to say, it remains a formidably brawny ensemble. These musicians eat red meat and lift weights, sonically speaking. The brass section is still an almost terrifying presence. The strings are a well-drilled unit, buttressed by the double basses, powerful, but luxurious rather than militaristic. The woodwinds nonchalantly shine, holding their own. The ease with which these sections coalesce and cooperate is remarkable. There's no shoving or elbowing. Everyone has his or her place and doesn't have to shout to be heard.

_ CULTURE AND ARTS: Don't worry, the debt crisis isn't going to shut down the Louvre in Paris or the Vienna State Opera House. Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened. As part of its austerity drive, Spain's new conservative government has eliminated the Culture Ministry as a self-standing institution, merging it with education and sports. A program to subsidize Spanish cinema — which made a name for itself around the world with Oscar-winning directors such Pedro Almodovar — has been scrapped. In Sweden, the government has decided to gradually dismantle a subsidy program that provided lifelong income guarantees for artists seen as particularly important to Swedish culture.

As our tour group gazes at the view from the slopes of Rano Kau — one of three extinct volcanic peaks on Easter Island — an explosion sounds in the valley below, followed by a puff of white smoke. "Don't worry, that's normal," our guide, Tom, says. "Well, normal dynamite." The blast, he explains, is caused by crews breaking up rocks for a construction project on the outskirts of Hanga Roa, the island's only town.

Green tea overflows with catechins, a plant nutrient that may be more protective than many others. What we don't know is how much of it is lost in the decaffeination process. There's a bit of evidence that decaf green tea may still protect against skin cancer.

Another Long Beach, this one in Pacific Rim National Park on the west coast of British Columbia's Vancouver Island, and the contiguous Schooner Cove beaches have nine miles of sand with driftwood, which visitors sometimes turn into seesaws or sculptures. The gray beach is backed by a temperate rainforest with conifers, sword ferns, moss, hanging lichens, epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants), deer, bears and, once in a while, a wolf or cougar. As you rove along, you might see Steller and California sea lions resting on small islands or playful river otters frolicking in the surf or even, if you're very lucky, sea otters in the sea. In the fall, you might see trumpeter swans along the mouth of Sandhill Creek. The area gets 120 inches of rain a year so come prepared for drizzle, mist, fog and rain.

"The four years with the most number of acres burned statewide between 1970 and 2010 were all below normal rainfall years," Null said. "If we look at the 10 biggest years for number of acres burned, seven of those 10 were below normal rainfall. If we look at the 20 worst years for fire, 16 of those 20 were below normal rainfall. That's 80 percent, so it's a pretty good correlation."

Mr. Maxwell argues that Mr. Leopold is misinterpreting the attorney general's opinion, and the matter is now before the State Board of Education for a decision. But this much is certain: The Anne Arundel County School System had $562,360,000 in county funds to cover the day-to-day costs of educating students in fiscal 2011, and despite an increase in enrollment, it had $556,105,600 for the same purpose in 2012. What Mr. Leopold did may have been legal, but it also shortchanged students.

Fielder didn't fit. Yeah, I believed that. The Tigers already had two $20 million-a-year players. They already had a great first baseman, signed through 2015, and a big-time designated hitter, who is out injured this year but is signed for two more years after that. Prince Fielder didn't fit with the Tigers, just like he didn't fit with the Yankees or the Red Sox or the Phillies. Yeah, I believed that, and now I can't figure out why I did. Because here's what I should have believed: Mike Ilitch is 82 years old, and he's every bit as determined to win a World Series as Arte Moreno is in Anaheim, every bit as determined as the Steinbrenners are in New York. And if Prince Fielder was the guy who might put the Tigers over the top, Ilitch and his baseball people were going to try like heck to make it fit."

The animated Disney film, on which the musical is based, handled the mix of grownup themes and kiddie fare with aplomb; the stage version isn't always as successful.

"The Cubs will be heavenly in '67ly!" Ernie Banks enthused. Sounded right to me. That was the year my parents first allowed me to go to the ballpark without parental supervision. It was day baseball, they figured, and walking distance, safe enough if I went with a friend like Billy Foster or Casey Dinges.

Humans and other mammals have two major types of immunity; intriguingly, neither birds nor reptiles share these immune defenses. Type 1 immunity involves the defense against viruses, bacteria and the like. It is an active defense in which cells from the immune system engulf and destroy the invaders.

It is more of a passive defense in which the body erects barriers against invasion. Conventional wisdom says that allergens share some structural similarities with these parasites that mistakenly cause the body to direct an immune defense against them.

Everything is running smoothly until Robert arrives. He's a nerdy bumpkin from Minnesota, played with great timing and delicious naivete by Leif Norby, who sure would like a girl of his own. Bernard gives him the rundown of how he balances three girlfriends. When poor Robert tries to remember everything, the real fun begins. There are the typical French farce doors that open and shut with characters popping in and out. There's plenty of hilarious physical action, including falls, spills and visual gags. It's the swinging '60s, and the girls in their bright, mini-skirted airline uniforms create a flurry of color.

A dozen figurines lining a plywood shelf tweak other tropes of masculinity. Many feature small, stocky men, gruff, old-school types with cigars clamped in the corners of their mouths. Two work as coopers, and another two as lumbermen.

Each of the tax breaks the Buffett rule would override was designed to provide an incentive for something Congress wanted to promote, or to restrict something lawmakers wanted to discourage. For example, the lower rate for investment income is designed to encourage saving and to make more money available for businesses to grow. The cap on wages subject to Social Security taxes limits the amount of monthly benefits that those with high incomes can collect when they retire. And the deduction for mortgage interest is designed to help families acquire large assets and promote more stable neighborhoods.

I also saved a lot of my money and put it in investments, and I'm fortunate that I can afford to pay the $1,200 a month that I have to pay for medication because of the doughnut hole in the program that we have.

You sold your home through a short sale.

I have my own family to support. Why should my hard-earned tax dollars be used to support them as well?

Strassel: This is a miss for President Obama's campaign team, which this week on a website publicly named and shamed eight private citizens for the crime of donating to Mitt Romney's campaign. Ever since Nixon's enemies list, presidents have been careful about not targeting private individuals for their politics, and for good reason.

"His energy, his enthusiasm is amazing," Blazers assistant coach Bill Bayno said. "And his willingness to work and spend time with (players) is invaluable. Once you develop that bond with them, I think, you really connect and have an influence and really keep them focused and get them to buy into what Nate wants taught. And once you have that bond and get that respect, then guys will listen to you and you can get them to over-achieve and make adjustments."

The big reveal, part II: Danielle gathers her daughters Christine and Jillian together on the pretense of showing them some pictures. We don't get to see the pictures -- they're blurred out -- but from the girls' reactions, they ain't exactly Sears photo studio material. "My modeling days were a little hedonistic at times," Danielle says, apparently working her way up slowly to "there's this book that refers to me as a 'coke whore' that you'll be hearing a lot about in a few months." Danielle calls it "damage control." We don't actually see her telling her kids what she tells her cameras -- that she stripped, that she was arrested, that she changed her name -- and there wouldn't be much point, because it's pretty obvious from her kids' blase reactions that she's already prepped them in private.

Refined sugar -- not the kind found naturally in fruit -- is bad for us because it quickly spikes our blood-sugar levels. If we overload our bodies with it, we store the excess as fat.

The recommended daily consumption is nine teaspoons for men, six for women and three teaspoons for children.

That's become the question to ask this week, as you look around a conference that has long been known around the country as thin. It's been USC and everyone else in prior years. And last season, Oregon and Stanford, then a puddle of questions.

HOW IT WORKS: The U-shaped, bendable light is extremely adaptable. For example, a camper, hiker or backpacker can hang the light from the neck, with the LED "arms" bent up for better illumination. It also can be bent around objects or hung from the top of a tent. Two AAA batteries power it for as long as 40 hours (the manufacturer says). Each flashlight head has a spotlight bulb and a wide-angle bulb. They can light separately or simultaneously. Easily accessed buttons atop the lights turn them on and also cycle through the brightness options.

Cedric Parker, 23, of Cleveland: Sentenced Monday by Judge John Sutula to 24 years in prison for felonious assault on a police officer using a gun, aggravated robbery and kidnapping. Parker and a 16-year-old boy, both wearing masks June 26, robbed the Family Dollar store at 3407 Payne Ave. Parker pointed a gun at the 47-year-old store manager and demanded money from the safe, Assistant Prosecutor Brian Radigan said.

The teen, now 17, was arrested and sentenced in juvenile court to detention until his 21st birthday with the possibility of six years in adult prison.

The Tea Fire was raging across the hills of Montecito, and T.C. Boyle was worried. He was worried about the safety of his home, as anyone near the flames would be, and that concern was amplified by the fact that the nearly century-old house was designed by no less than Frank Lloyd Wright.

Everything that had gone into writing two dozen books and 150 stories was stashed in Boyle's basement. If the wind shifted, it would all be lost.

I want to add that to the previous thing of what the mayor can do to help the arts economy is that we can go down to Salem and lobby for support not only for the Cultural Trust but also the film and video tax credit.

It's not a play that should be involved in basketball. I know Ron. Unfortunately, it did happen, but you can't do that. It's unacceptable."
The effect is startling but also somewhat harsh and unsparing. It's uncomfortably close to a kind of detached, tough love rather than an expression of affection.

Joe Freeman: There is no doubt that Jamal Crawford will opt out of his contract, and once he becomes a free agent, the Blazers will not pursue him. Crawford arrived in Rip City with much fanfare, promising to provide excitement, scoring and clutch play -- all while softening the blow of Brandon Roy's sudden retirement. But Crawford and the Blazers were a bad match from the beginning. He started slow, struggling to find his way with new teammates, and never meshed with coach Nate McMillan's plan to play him at both point and shooting guard. Crawford had some big scoring nights, but was mostly inconsistent during his lone season in Portland and even he would acknowledge he had a disappointing season. Crawford will be a sought-after free agent, but the Blazers will not be among his suitors.

In contrast, anger arises as a response to a negative event that a person feels gets in the way of his goals. Anxiety leads people to overestimate risk and do nothing; anger tends to lower one's sense of perceived threat and leads to heightened risk-taking.

You say she is friendly. This is the key the panelists mention the most. Stay curious and interested, but unless she becomes depressed, out-of-sorts, reluctant to go to school, or her grades fall, trust that she is handling things just right.

Not only that, but many lawmakers will be running in new territory after a census that led to redrawn district boundaries. That means they'll be courting voters unfamiliar with their work.

The Republicans will hope that, having given them control of at least one house of Congress, you will also give them all kinds of slack to "govern according to political realities."

Providence always has prided itself on being different. The city was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, after he was booted from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His crime? Radical thinking, if you consider the separation of church and state a radical idea. That dedication to religious freedom endures. Providence houses the first Baptist Church in America. The country's oldest Quaker meeting house and oldest synagogue are located in Newport, 30 minutes away. The city celebrates cultural diversity, too, with thriving Italian, Jewish, Portuguese and Irish neighborhoods.

That doesn't mean there aren't other trade-offs. Mostly to make room for a larger battery, the new iPad weighs about 8% more and is about 7% thicker than the prior model.

They've been able to stay above the fact that it's Johns Hopkins. They've been able to stay above the emotion of playing a top-ranked opponent. To them, it's the next game on the schedule. So that's where I would start as a coach, and that's why we've continued to have success. They've prepared the same way week in and week out. They're not preparing for a jersey, but they're preparing for an opponent. Obviously for the university, it's a huge game. It's a sellout atmosphere here at Ridley and it's the reason we built this facility, to play games like this. It's going to be an exciting day."

This is one component of Issue 2 that should be rethought if the measure passes. Another is the ban on public-employee strikes -- already rare in Ohio -- that also would distort bargaining. Finally, the General Assembly would need to excise provisions -- notably a ban on collecting "fair share" dues from bargaining unit members who refuse to join the union, but reap the benefits of representation -- that organized labor views as a threat to its existence. Such a ban is needless -- and needlessly provocative.
The good news: FareCompare's Seaney says "international travel is going to have the best deals in the last three to four years," due to decreases in fuel surcharges and some new start-up routes with introductory prices.

We continue to have many loyal donors to the University. The generous financial gifts from our benefactors help us support our students and academic programs. But like everything else, our fundraising has been affected by the economy. Most other non-profit institutions are seeing the same thing.

Our students change lives, and that is more important than ever.

For example, Woods was a 22-year-old hotshot and ranked No. 1 in the summer of 1998, the last time the Open visited Olympic. He struggled and finished in a tie for 18th place, 10 shots behind Janzen.

"Initially I was very skeptical," says Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London-based Burgess, the yacht broker. "When you just see photos, it's a very strange-looking boat.

Everything comes out of the two of us practicing and playing together, coming up with riffs and rhythms.”

Santa Monica College officials say that Cal Grants and private donations to a special fund will cover the added cost for low-income students, so that this would not become an option only for the affluent. But Cal Grants, which provide financial aid to low- and moderate-income California families, are based on the type of college the students attend. Students at community colleges receive a certain stipend, University of California students another, and so forth. There are some supplemental funds students can apply for, but it's not clear that Cal Grants would provide them for this purpose. The program can't cover students' expenses if every community college in the state starts quadrupling the price of its most popular classes. If private donors step forward, Santa Monica College should use their money to fund classes at the regular price.

Any analysis of the race's impact needs to be tempered with the knowledge that it is the first year of a five-year commitment. We can't expect it to be as successful in its first run as it is in its fifth, and the city's investment in money and hassle was heavily front-loaded. But we do need to avoid a repeat of the Washington Grand Prix, which went so badly that the city and race officials pulled the plug after the first year. The race doesn't need to be a "game changer" for Baltimore, as the mayor once suggested, in order to be considered a success. It just needs to bring in enough money to compensate the city for its expenses and residents for their inconvenience.

Yes, I typically do these mental calculations, at least in the back of my mind, for most things. A "$50" lunch at Morton's really costs $200. A "$5,000" trip to Bali: $20,000. And so on.

There is one wonderful part that, all on its own, raises this to a two-star movie. Unfortunately, it’s not actually in the movie, but in the short that plays before it — “Hawaiian Vacation,” a “Toy Story” vignette that has Woody and Buzz trying to engineer a romantic trip for Ken and Barbie. It’s inventive, nicely animated and very, very funny.
A project space is a different animal from a commercial gallery or an institutional space. It can be freer and looser, which can be good or not.

At a presidential debate in California last week, Mr. Perry decried Social Security as a "Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you're paying into a program that's going to be there.

(This is the interactive portion of today's column where you get to say the Browns should wait until next year to grab USC's Matt Barkley -- as if that would be any easier than acquiring RGIII; and where I remind you that if they're bad enough through November to project at the top of the draft again next year, we should all hope the Mayans are right.

10. "Boardwalk Empire" (HBO): Still uneven in its second season, the Roaring '20s drama nonetheless remains an intoxicating brew about Prohibition and the price of power. Atlantic City kingpin Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) regained control of the town and beat the legal rap against him, but it would be a stretch to suggest that all is right with his volatile world. The series certainly set itself challenges for the third season, killing off such popular characters as Angela (Aleksa Palladino), the Commodore (Dabney Coleman) and Jimmy (Michael Pitt).

Freighters go by. People are out fishing in smaller boats and from the shore. A school field trip departs on a boat tour. Pure Michigan is right here, where office workers can soak it up on their lunch hour and families can bring their kids to play anytime.

Devotees of man-on-the-spot military histories are wiling to accept the rough edges in presentation because the stories are so compelling. In "Joker One," though, the storytelling is smooth and professional. Campbell writes with precision where he can, with a brisk pace, with humor and with a deep understanding of the men he commanded. The book is full of character sketches that make his noncommissioned officers and some of his enlisted men real people, with distinctive, endearing and annoying qualities, rather than pawns on history's chessboard.

As tension on the ropes increased, my fall slowed and I swung back and forth, those enormous murals growing and shrinking and coming and going at crazy angles, the sound system throbbing below. Eventually the Earth came up to gently greet me. It was a hoot. I hope the World Cup works out the same way.
The ordinance prohibits local government approval of businesses, activities or land-use applications “which are violative of federal law.” That category would include medical marijuana cultivation sites like the one Breakwater has proposed.

Much of the tumult an IPO creates has to do with the so-called "lockup period" that keeps company insiders from selling stock within the first six months after going public. Epiphany's shares, for instance, made their debut at $16 apiece in September 1999. By March 2000, they topped $211.

At the start of the last century, the landscape architect -- nephew and adopted son of the legendary Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of New York's Central Park -- mapped out Portland's parks system and suggested that the city buy a lush wooded stretch of the West Hills for future use and preservation.

Then you just need to slide it onto a plate for serving.

According to the Engine Rebuilders Council, a remanufactured engine that is completed by a trained professional usually has a warranty rate of 5 percent or less. Not every engine rebuild is certified by top automotive manufacturers, and strict requirements must be met before engine sellers can use registered trademarks for remanufactured engines branding. Some of the regulations include oil compression tests, ignition tests and mileage certifications to ensure that consumers are well informed about an engine that includes a trademark like Ford, Dodge or Chevy. The industry standard warranty for a rebuilt engine is approximately 1 year or 12,000 miles. The warranty extension by RemanufacturedEnginesforSale.com now exceeds this warranty coverage period by 24 months to help cover damage to rebuilt Ford engines for cars and trucks.

For one thing, Washington made a skilled and patient instructor, gently adding new moves into the mix one at a time. From him, I got a lesson in awareness, learning how to sense my surroundings while running backwards in circles. He also went the extra mile and paused to help me stretch my hips, shoulders and legs

Mr. Smith brings youth and energy to the table, plus a wealth of valuable experience from his military career. He has worked extensively in finance and information technology, which would be useful skills for a local legislator. The large number of veterans, reservists and active duty military in Anne Arundel makes Mr. Smith's time in the Marines even more useful for the council. Mr. Smith also identifies himself as a political moderate — his wife is a Republican, so evidently he has some experience in working across the aisle.

Since the first column I wrote about hotel guest profiles more than a decade ago, I've been deeply concerned about my own privacy as a traveler. Any time a hotel delivers my favorite newspaper (this one, of course) or leaves a fruit basket with apples (Pink Ladies) I get a little suspicious. How did they know?

No one is more eager to get started than Dutton, 36, one of the league's all-time best at his position. In the 2011 season opener at Spokane, Dutton played superbly into the fourth quarter before tearing his left Achilles' tendon. He did not return until the Gladiators' opening-round playoff loss to Georgia; playing well in relief of a struggling Kurt Rocco.
Karzai told a meeting of his Cabinet that the attacks represented "an intelligence failure for us and especially NATO," according to a presidential palace statement.

Thus, Millier today is overseeing the output of between 350,000 and 400,000 cases annually, and quality has likely never been as consistent and as high. His current lineup includes a 2009 reserve Sierra foothills chardonnay that is classically Californian  rich, ripe, spicy and smoky  yet agile and crisp. His 2010 Lodi old-vine zinfandel is an unusually youthful and lithe take for the genre, yet sings with fresh varietal character.
Kuntupis and Peals are still fighting to regain custody nearly two years after losing both children: Stephanie, now 3, and her older brother, 14-year-old Romero. Their struggle stings all the more because the Cruz-Reyeses regained custody of their children -- then 11 and 13 -- roughly two months after Stephanie was hospitalized.
For decades, residents of Gozo -- they're called Gozitans -- were ordered to spend every night within the fortress walls. Today, these walls hold museums of archaeology, folklore, natural science and church history, the latter of which is next to the Cathedral of the Assumption, built from 1697 to 1711. After visiting the cathedral, I toured its museum, and was curious about a small but amusing collection of papal shoes.

Consider the little boy who had never had a book read to him until that first day of school. And the girl who gave a quizzical look when she was told to put her toys on a shelf. She didn't know what a shelf was. And the boy who was trying to put together a puzzle above his head -- in the air -- rather than on a flat surface. He'd never seen a puzzle before.

The threat was unfounded and the nature of the threat is a matter of an ongoing investigation."
The particulars of the crime are not Ceylan's chief concern. From outside the smeared window of a rural service station, he provides a brief glimpse of the parties involved, just before the murder. From there the film (whose screenplay is by the director, Ercan Kesal and Ebru Ceylan) becomes a road trip of official pursuit and private anxiety.
Practice, practice, practice. It's paying off.
Some fear Islamist domination, some think it's time for Islamists to hold power. Others are torn between wanting a strongman — someone who knows the ins and outs of the old regime and the military — or a revolutionary with new vision.

The National Religious Campaign Against Torture was formed in 2006 to be the interfaith religious voice urging a return to our moral values and to hold accountable those who violated these values. I join the organization in calling for the U.S. government to convene a commission of inquiry to investigate — and to understand — what led to our use of torture. The next step will be to seek accountability and codify laws that will not permit this descent into immorality again.

Hey, Tony: As good as it looked to get Peyton Hillis in a trade for Brady Quinn, how bad would it look if Hillis walked away and we got nothing in return? Knowing now what we do of the WCO, if you could call a mulligan and maybe just tweak last year's ground and pound instead of completely switching schemes, would you? This upcoming draft could either make our defense elite or make our offense watchable, what direction do you choose? -- Eliot Clasen, Cape Coral, Fla.

How to Throw a Sangria & Tapas Party
One of the worst games the Bears played under Mike Ditka ended with one of the most exhilarating finishes.

"I wore my own clothes back then, which were not very good, and I cut my own hair, which also was not very good," Williams said. "I still remember the feeling that in this room, unlike others, that that was OK. Possibly even preferred.

Obama: A fourth-straight year of trillion-dollar deficits is projected.

Cataract Canyon: From Laurel Dell picnic site, turn left on the Cataract Trail for a 1-mile descent into the canyon to see Cataract Falls, a series of pretty cascade-type waterfalls in a lush setting. The trail leads all the way down to Bolinas-Fairfax Road (670 feet elevation) west of Alpine Dam (parking areas fills up here Sunday mornings).

Once the list of musicals appeared on the blog, I heard about some titles I'd missed. So, with the help of several correspondents, here's an expanded list of Chicago's long-running Broadway shows. I'm not including reprise engagements, which is why I don't include the fast return of "The Lion King." (Sorry Disney, but you were too slow to trust Chicago audiences). Hope the list jogs some pleasant memories:

You could see the underside of the metal roof and certainly it was noisy, but that's not the case in modern construction. That's one of the objections I have to overcome is the perception that it's noisy."

One of MOCA's biggest challenges, Deitch said, is raising money for shows like "Ends of the Earth," which documents an important development in art but lacks star power. It's much easier, he said, to raise money for shows by popular figures, "where collectors are excited about the artists and brands want to be connected to the artists' image. Fundraising for historical shows with great artists who don't include today's art-world stars is a great challenge."

Chavez's good pal Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is going through some difficulties of his own. The Iranian president, whose own hate-filled speeches have triggered walkouts at the U.N. -- as when he said most people blame Washington for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- is gradually losing power. The ayatollahs who helped him retain the presidency after the protests that followed the disputed 2009 election have had enough of Ahmadinejad. He got too big for his britches, and now the turbaned ones want him out. He may or may not stay in office, but he has lost much of his power.

public access to all data about hospitals' quality of care, infection rates and other adverse events also makes sense. Right now, it's up to individual states to decide whether statistics are made public. Only about half the states allow public access to some information. Illinois does. Missouri doesn't, but should.

Anyone who has been to the Pride Parade can attest to the potential for unruliness.

Air travel before 9/11: There was terrorism before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but that day changed the mindset of traveling, particularly abroad. Security necessities have made the trip through airports simultaneously tense and tedious. It's necessary and I've become used to the drill (though not as smoothly as George Clooney's Ryan Bingham character in "Up In the Air").
The new start he will be thinking about soon enough is the start to next season, and the Knicks are trying to figure out how they are ever going to get past the Heat. Of course the Miami Heat isn't ever going to be as good as Michael Jordan's Bulls were in the '90s, but the Knicks have to wonder if they have about as much chance of getting past the Heat as the Knicks of the '90s had of getting past Michael.
Finally, and perhaps most problematic, is that you agree that damage happened to your car while it was in your possession, though not by your usage. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter. If the car was dented when you had it, you're responsible.

Limbaugh's main point in his criticism of McMillan's book was that government shouldn't get involved in the distribution of quality food to urban neighborhoods. ... But Limbaugh's last comment on the matter: "What is it with all these young single white women, overeducated -- doesn't mean intelligent," he said. "Tracie McMillan, the author of this book, seems to be just out of college and already she has been showered with awards ... for social justice journalism."But Politico's Keach Hagey believes the radio host "will no longer command the same kind of fealty from Republicans in Washington" that forced GOP leaders like former party chairman Michael Steele to quickly apologize after criticizing Limbaugh in 2009. "It will now be much more permitted on the conservative side to dissent from Rush," said Michael Medved, a conservative talk radio host who subbed for Limbaugh in the 1990s.

As far as I could tell from two visits to the Dog House, the "dog" theme extends only as far as hot dogs on the menu and a cigar-smoking dog in the bar's logo.

It's through the lyrics that Coons hopes he will have an impact on the listener. "There are so many bands out there. Lyrically is where I think we might stand out, versus most folk-rock-country bands. Lyrically, it's a matter of being really open and vulnerable, not being afraid to let yourself go to places that aren't comfortable. That's difficult. But when I've been able to do that in the past, that's when songs really get the reaction and people really connect. People come up and tell me how much our songs have affected them. That's very powerful and makes me want to do it. I like songs that really go places emotionally. That doesn't always mean being sad. But even when it's happy music, it's going further and really being honest in the songwriting.

I don't know of any law that dictates what specific questions can be asked in an interview. I believe this idea of what questions should and should not be asked comes from the desire to avoid potential problems if a person is not hired. If the interviewer does not ask age-related questions, then the argument they discriminated based on age is harder to make. I believe the law simply states that companies can't discriminate in their hiring based on age. Therefore, it is wise to avoid any appearance of using age as a factor when interviewing.

All drugs are not the same. Different drugs have very different effects on us. Therefore, we need a nuanced policy that reflects these differences. As a general proposition, we should impose greater restrictions on the more dangerous drugs. As simple as that proposition may sound, our current policy is far from it. For example, tobacco and alcohol are responsible for 20 times more deaths than all illegal drugs combined. Yet we impose minimal restrictions on tobacco and alcohol.

But only three other states have passed parent trigger laws — Connecticut, Mississippi and Texas — and it's a stretch to put Connecticut's law in the same category, because parents there were given merely an advisory role with no authority. Last month, Florida's legislature rejected a trigger bill, and many of the fiercest opponents were parents. Nine other states are considering such legislation, but even the Education Trust, a strongly reform-oriented nonprofit group, has expressed concerns about the trigger as it is currently constructed.

The prosecutors did not challenge the juror because of his homosexual lifestyle. They removed the man because he was active in the gay rights movement, and his political views may have enabled an untoward bias. The state is prosecuting improper demonstration in front of a clerk's office, not the status and lifestyle of individuals in the nation.
The committee is backing two bills. The first is a long-overdue requirement that legislators' financial disclosure forms (and later those of other government officials) be posted online. Now they are only available at the state ethics commission's office in Annapolis, and legislators are notified of the identities of those who review the forms, which tends to have a chilling effect on the examination of what are, in fact, public documents. But the second bill reduces the level of disclosure required for local government officials. It comes in response to unsubstantiated fears by local officials and relies on faulty assumptions about the difference between state and local government.

What I discovered firsthand is what I already knew intuitively: Democracy is a messy, often shortsighted, unreasoned and selfish process. People have interests, beliefs and prejudices that, once firmly entrenched, are not easily dislodged -- and certainly not by logic or evidence.

Random urine tests can say a lot about a person, like that she either got the dog to pee into a cup or could one day give birth to a fine litter of Labradoodles. Drug addicts lie. Yours has been lying to you from day one, and not about inconsequential stuff. (Don’t run to get an HIV test; grow wings and fly there.) Your girlfriend’s motto appears to be “Just say ‘Don’t mind if I do!’ to drugs.” You could say she’s been cheating on you with drugs. Actually, she’s been cheating on drugs with you. Make no mistake about what comes first and who comes second. That’s not going to change overnight -- and maybe not ever. You can someday have a loving, mutual relationship -- once you find a partner whose moments of painful honesty involve admitting to stuff like scraping your new car getting into the garage, not “Oh, I had sex with a crackhead I met in rehab. And how was your day?”

A homeowner also may be eligible to receive a credit equal to 30 percent of the cost of alternative energy systems like solar hot-water heaters or geothermal heat pumps.

My third thought was a memory: About 10 years ago, I appeared on WJR's "Paul W. Smith Show." The convivial host and I talked then about what we talk about now: Detroit's problems with crime, finances, corruption and schools.
Next week, I expect to give birth to our second child. The amazing feat, however, is that - barring some unforeseen slip of the tongue - I will have made it through an entire pregnancy without revealing to my husband whether our new baby is a boy or a girl.

Cabezon bills itself as a "restaurant and fish market" -- although you don't really have to fear sitting next to a halibut staring at you from a bed of ice; the fish appears afternoons -- and many of its most striking offerings are indeed maritime. Roasted cod appears in a torrent of textures, the sweet flakiness of the fish set off by crisp Vidalia onion rings and crunchy Tokyo turnips. On another evening-- the menu is somewhat flexible -- the cod is accompanied by a cousin, crisp pieces of brandade, smoked cod mixed with potato.

That CU-Nebraska game, given the rivalry at the time, was so intense already, and was heightened given the emotion around it. I remember our director Joe Acenti, who just passed away in October, always said it was one of his favorite game broadcasts. The way he cut that show, it was like a movie. It didn't feel like you were calling a football game. It felt like you were a narrator in the background of this incredible Hollywood script that was playing out on the big screen.

"Let's not go there yet," Shurmur said. "I think they're all getting used to it. I think he catches the ball fine and he's fast-fast. In my opinion, for the most part the guys caught the ball pretty well. I think he's got good hands and he'll show it."

It's one of the better, more informative uses of talking heads you'll see in film.
In Los Angeles and across the country, education officials have long known of the often huge disparities among teachers. They've seen the indelible effects, for good and ill, on children. But rather than analyze and address these disparities, they have opted mostly to ignore them.

Hedgecock also blames Obama for the high unemployment rate for college grads. Hedgecock again misleads by only citing the unemployment rate for grads under 25, while the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, just reported an unemployment rate for college grads 25 and over is 4.2 percent for March 2012.

The sale of their old home is pending, and the pair has already picked out a new house adjacent to a cemetery.
Even as viewing habits change and some audiences now mostly watch their movies at home, there is much to celebrate about le cinema. Movies end, even obliquely, while television shows are specifically designed to go on and on, giving movies a satisfying narrative compactness and resolution that television can rarely match. The emotional gut-punch of a film such as the recent British thriller "Kill List" gains its power in part because when it's over, that's it, audiences are left reeling to grasp for themselves the death blow of the film's moral sinkhole and sort through their own feelings without the cushion of more to come.
The Ducks are heavy favorites. Oddsmakers have predicted another blowout victory in Autzen, this one by at least 30 points. But UCLA defensive coordinator Joe Tresey thinks Odighizuwa has some physical tools that could cause Oregon problems.

But I didn't recall the wacky 1957 Cornell-Liberty Safety Car. The car was made by Cornell Aeronautial Laboratory in Buffalo, N.Y, and funded by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.

April is the start of the California blueberry crop, a short season that generally ends in June, when domestic blueberries are sourced from Oregon and Washington through early July. East Coast blueberries are picked June through August. That region is the source for wild blueberries that are very sweet and, unlike cultivated varieties, are blue inside and out. Wild blueberries are delicious, but way more expensive.

The rationale for the 1973 Measure A rebellion remains apparent to even the most casual observer.

During that period, it has been estimated that single-family homes were being torn down at the rate of one every five days.

Squatting uncomfortably in the brush, I was just starting to doubt Mr. Ramírez's tactics when a mournful wail heralded the arrival of a common potoo, a bird that normally renders itself nearly invisible by perching immobile on tree stumps. A ruby-crowned tanager hopped into view, followed by a trio of blue manakins, the males' scarlet caps bold against their turquoise bodies. Within minutes, the males began to dance, hopping and pirouetting in an elaborate courtship ritual; a drab, olive-backed female looked fixedly away, unimpressed.

At the start of each offseason, the Bill James Handbook drops, and near the back each year is something called "The Favorite Toy". What the Toy does is predict a player's chances of reaching a historic milestone based on age and the career curve of his production. James calculates the chances of players reaching 1,000 career stolen bases (Carl Crawford, 6 percent), 4,000 hits (Jeter, 3 percent), 2,000 RBIs (Rodriguez, 96 percent) and, yes, 900 home runs (Pujols, 2 percent as the only player listed). Basically, the Toy relies on a player's average season and a rate of diminishing production based on age.

As for the narrative of "Extra Lives," it feels at once enchanting and labyrinthine, like a primeval wood. Throughout the book, Bissell's game as a memoirist tends toward peek-a-boo rather than show-and-tell: He repeatedly refers to an unexplained trauma he experienced in Uzbekistan (for the curious, "Chasing the Sea," Bissell's admirable account of travel through central Asia, offers full elucidation).

You get the idea. I'm a dog person. So it will come as no surprise that I am an ardent proponent of animal blessings. I don't feel as strongly about other pets as I do about dogs, but I am keenly aware that many people do love their pets every bit much as I love mine, even when that pet is not a dog. When it's a cat or a hampster or something furry and cute, I can understand (even when I secretly think the person is missing out on the more sublime pleasure of dog ownership--I know when to keep my mouth shut). When it's something creeping or scaly or reptilic I'm hard-pressed to say I "get it," but I respect the person's choice. Perhaps there's something noble about lavishing care and affection on a tarantula. Who am I to judge?
While the Mexican dishes might be more familiar to north-of-the-border palates (the seafood soups, chock-full of fish and what looks like half a crab is tempting), get adventurous and try the cuisines of Central America. Spices are more subdued, but flavors are not. The pupusas -- kind of like a thick stuffed tortilla -- are filling, delicious and inexpensive, at $2 each, served with kimchi-style pickled vegetables. Try the pupusa with cheese and loroco, an El Salvadoran edible flower bud that adds a vegetal nuttiness. Other winners are the plantains -- spiced, sweetened and fried to starchy goodness, and Pepian -- chicken in a mild pumpkin mole-style sauce. Wash it down with a Guatemalan or Salvadoran beer or Mexican soda.

The NBA has averaged about 15 reported concussions the past five years, a league source said, a fraction of totals in the NFL and NHL.

I ordered the sirloin steak ($24.95) medium rare. The irregular cut was beyond well done on the thin side and medium well on the thick side. Two lamb chops ($19.95), ordered medium, were devoid of any pink. Both the meat items were unseasoned and lacked the caramelized crust that makes a steak special.
Joel Salatin is a farmer with a message for the masses: You, too, can earn a living off the land without selling out. Pastured poultry, he says, yields greater profits and less pollution than standard methods. For Salatin, farming is above all a spiritual calling, and his charisma and evangelical zeal have turned him into something of a celebrity-prophet for the sustainable agriculture movement.
Can he do the same for Harbor City, or the very different demographics of Harbor Gateway and Wilmington, and the seemingly worlds-away region of Watts?

It is that same arrogance of power which the former Senator from Arkansas, J. William Fulbright, saw shrouded in the deceit which carried us into the abyss of the war in Vietnam.

Joni James: There is one dynamic in a three-way race that no one can predict in post-Obama Florida. The ballot would have a Hispanic (Cuban-American) Republican, a black Democrat and a white independent.

But the most important reason these gambling cafes need to be shut down is gambling brings costs to society and taxpayers. According to a recent exposé in BusinessWeek, most Internet gambling cafe patrons are elderly and poor. Many of the locations even dispense welfare cash. Crime and addiction are the inevitable consequences of predatory gambling. Because of the convenient access to highly addictive gambling they provide, these establishments make millions preying on those who can least afford it. That means more people addicted to gambling, more dependency on taxpayer funded support programs, and more crime committed to support gambling addictions.

A bit more subtle but nonetheless signature Sputnik is the Standard 18 Arm Sputnik Lamp, $329.99, from Inmod. The half chrome candelabra base bulbs (for an additional $55) featured at the end of each arm further flatter the light's unadorned, svelte shape. The simplicity of this particular chrome-plated light would suit a married-in-pop room or add a peek of retro-chic to a contemporary space. Without bulbs, it measures 24 inches wide and is 15 inches long.

This is complex territory, emotionally and theatrically, yet this production stays remarkably surefooted at every step. There’s plenty of spot-on physical humor (Isaac Lamb and Tim True moving in lock-step as a pair of self-loathing “insecurity guards,” John Steinkamp’s tap-dance solo amid a music-hall style welcoming ceremony) and zany miscellany (Val Stevens playing accordion while dressed in a hot-dog suit). And heaping helpings of credit should go to Sam Kusnetz, whose musical compositions, sound design and video projections create the greater part of the first act’s fanciful world.

All of the booths tend to be popular, but the year I attended, the line waiting to sample Shively and Gene Lampson's fare was the longest of them all, no doubt because the Lampsons were serving a deeply chocolate, richly delicious tart - one of the best desserts ever.

This remains the case with the six second-season episodes HBO made available to critics. Still, the ongoing sense of danger remains palatable and the ever-shifting web of allegiances, if anything, increases the tension in this sophomore season.
When do jihadists apologize for mass murder or religious persecution? Two years ago in Rasht, Iran, Youcef Nadarkhani, a Christian pastor who converted from Islam, was arrested on charges of apostasy. He has been sentenced to hang for his religious conversion.

"Yankee" may well have begun life as a slur that English colonists hurled at Dutch freebooters in early New York. The Dutch love of cheese was well known, so the English fashioned Yankee from the Dutch "Jan Kass," which literally meant "John Cheese," combining the Dutch first name "Jan" (pronounced "Yahn") with "Kaas," the Dutch word for "cheese," the country's national product.

Getting the economy moving again needs the pump primed. You can't get the pump flowing again with air, a certificate of appreciation and tightfistedness.

Back on the beach, teams align their beach chairs perfectly and head off to climb the limestone cliffs. Finally Cathi and Bill head off, leaving just Liz and Marie on the beach toiling to make their umbrellas stay up in the sand and wind. The poor girls have been in the sun for close to three hours and they are really at wit's end. All is not lost, however, because somehow Ernie and Cindy have gotten lost at sea and are unable to find the location of the Roadblock. At some point Ernie realizes his navigational error and corrects course. On the beach, Liz and Marie are quickly unraveling and start yelling, "Shut up!" at each other as they continue their struggle until, at last, the tears have dried and they complete the challenge.

"Political thriller" hardly hints at the scope of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature -- in German with excellent English subtitles -- but you've got to start somewhere. (The filmmaker seems to have started at the top of his profession; his film, nominated for an Oscar, is as good as contemporary cinema gets.) First and foremost, he has turned a bright light on a dark, squalid domain of the former East Germany -- the Stasi, or secret police, whose declared goal was "to know everything" in that Communist nation of 17 million souls, and whose 100,000 employees, working with as many as 200,000 informants, sustained a reign of pervasive terror from 1950 until 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. Rather than dwell on the darkness and squalor, however, he has fashioned a genuinely thrilling tale, leavened with sly humor, that works ingenious variations on the theme of cat and mouse, speaks to current concerns about personal privacy and illuminates the timeless conflict between totalitarianism and art.

øFumes coming out of mystic caves figure in big ways in ancient Greek mythology, such as the classical Oracle of Delphi who foretold the future of kings and empires. Although that was thousands of years ago, around 1400 B.C., after the closure of Alepotrypa Cave, such a relationship was suggested by the Greek archaeologist George Papathanassopoulos, who led excavations at the site starting in the 1970's. He speculated that the ancient Greek notion of Hades, a gloomy and misty home for the dead, may have had its origins in the cave's rituals.

It was Klinsmann, after all, who demanded control of the entire U.S. program — including the junior teams — when he was hired last summer.

Hartel will mark his eleventh year at Guitar Bar in August - "the longest job I've ever had in my life, by far," he notes - and reports that business remains surprisingly strong. "Of course you always have kids coming in who want to learn how to play," he explains. "But in Hoboken we also get these young urban professionals who get out of college, get their first apartment, get their first job, and now they're at a place in their life when they've got a little expendable income for the first time and they start asking what they can do for themselves. What they always say is, 'I always wanted to learn how to play the guitar,' and so they do. And that's really very rewarding. You're helping people feel like they have more contact with music. These aren't people who really ever want to start playing publicly or want to get super awesome, it just enriches the listening experience for them by getting to understand music a little better. So they keep coming. So we must be doing something right."

He returned to Germany on the last scheduled steamer back across the Atlantic, saying that he was mistaken to have come in the first place, that he had to endure Germany's national crisis with his countrymen.

I am concerned about the information being passed by the Save Gladstone group. The group's latest flier overstated the cost of the Gladstone library by $5.6 million. They also mistakenly claim that 80 percent of the urban renewal fund will be depleted by the library project, when in fact the worst case is 27 percent. Most concerning of all is the list of numerous other projects and the implication that the city could use library funds for them. The truth is that the funds earmarked for the library cannot be used for those projects.
It was the fourth month in a row that the farm index contributed negatively to the index, and the second month that residential housing permits contributed positively.

It's mostly about delivery systems. I have a seventh- and eighth-grade English teacher who reads to her children in the voice of the characters of the book. That just brings the books to life. That's just one example, but it is about delivery systems often. You could be a very good English teacher and teach that novel a different way. There's no right or wrong. It's letting them do it the way it works for them.

The Committee on Infractions will take it into consideration along with everything else -- how cooperative Ohio State has been, the school's track record with the NCAA, the fact Jim Tressel and Terrelle Pryor, two of the violators, are no longer around. It's a bit of a poker game, and self-imposed violations make up only part of Ohio State's hand. But the NCAA won't make the penalties less severe, so we know 2010 is gone.

That's not how you grease somebody's palm, I guarantee you."
Not-So-Phab: This great comment came from a reader responding to last week's item about the impending emergence of tablets that double as phones: "It's bad enough that I have to constantly endure complete strangers' never-ending bellows and blather on their cell phones about the most intimate details of their personal lives or all-important business transactions, but I think I shall go completely unhinged if the guy beside me on the crowded 38-Geary bus whips out his 'phablet' and commences his conversation via speaker-phone.
